# Story 1.2: Data NFT Implementation

## Overview

This story covers the implementation of the Data NFT system, which serves as the fundamental identity and data ownership mechanism in the Rejuve Longevity App. Each Data NFT represents a user's membership in the network and manages their data sharing permissions on the blockchain.

## Technical Specifications

### Data NFT Architecture

The Data NFT is a non-fungible token based on ERC-721 standard with the following extensions:
- ERC-721Metadata for storing user permission metadata
- ERC-721Enumerable for improved enumeration
- Custom extension for data permission management

Each Data NFT contains:
1. **Unique Identifier**: Tied to the user's verified identity
2. **Permission Metadata**: Encoded data sharing permissions
3. **Data Fingerprints**: Hashed references to user's health data
4. **Timestamp Records**: Creation and modification timestamps
5. **Verification Proof**: Link to identity verification record

### ZKpass Integration

ZKpass provides zero-knowledge proof verification for user attributes without revealing actual data:

1. **Age Verification**: Proves user is above required age without revealing birth date
2. **Gender/Location Verification**: Confirms demographic information without exposing details
3. **Data Consistency**: Validates data hasn't been altered

Technical implementation includes:
- ZK-SNARK circuit implementation
- On-chain verification contracts
- Off-chain proof generation
- Mobile SDK integration

### Smart Contract Functions

1. **mintDataNFT(address user, bytes32 dataHash)**
   - Creates new Data NFT for verified user
   - Associates initial data hash
   - Assigns to user wallet address
   - Emits DataNFTCreated event

2. **updatePermissions(uint256 tokenId, bytes32 newPermissions)**
   - Updates permissions metadata
   - Requires signature from token owner
   - Emits PermissionsUpdated event

3. **verifyDataConsent(uint256 tokenId, bytes32 dataType)**
   - Checks if specified data type has consent
   - Returns boolean permission status
   - View-only function with no state change

4. **revokeAllPermissions(uint256 tokenId)**
   - Emergency function to revoke all sharing permissions
   - Requires owner signature
   - Emits AllPermissionsRevoked event

### App Integration

The integration with the mobile app includes:

1. **NFT Status Tracking**:
   - NFT creation/minting status display
   - Permission management UI
   - Data usage history view

2. **Backend Integration**:
   - NFT metadata synchronization
   - Permission status caching
   - Blockchain event monitoring

3. **Permission Management**:
   - Granular data type permission toggles
   - Batch permission updates
   - Permission expiration settings
   - Data usage analytics

## Implementation Steps

1. **Smart Contract Development**
   - Develop and test Data NFT contract
   - Deploy to test environment
   - Security audit by third party

2. **ZKpass Integration**
   - Implement ZK circuit for age/gender verification
   - Create proof generation service
   - Integrate verification in smart contract

3. **Mobile App Features**
   - Develop NFT status screens
   - Create permission management UI
   - Implement blockchain transaction handling

4. **Backend Services**
   - Create NFT metadata indexer
   - Develop caching layer for permissions
   - Implement event listeners for blockchain updates

5. **Testing**
   - Smart contract security testing
   - Permission management flow testing
   - Integration testing with identity verification
   - Performance testing for blockchain operations

## Security Considerations

- **Smart Contract Security**: Follow best practices and conduct thorough auditing
- **Private Key Protection**: Implement secure key management in mobile app
- **Permission Revocation**: Ensure immediate effect of permission changes
- **Metadata Privacy**: Encrypt sensitive metadata stored on-chain or in IPFS
- **Gas Fee Management**: Optimize transactions to minimize costs

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Data NFT is successfully minted after user completes verification
2. Users can view their NFT status and properties in the app
3. Permission changes are reflected on-chain within 5 minutes
4. ZKpass verification proves user attributes without revealing actual data
5. System handles network disruptions gracefully with retry mechanisms
6. NFT persists and remains accessible if user changes devices
7. All smart contract functions pass security audit

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Smart contract vulnerabilities | Critical | Third-party security audit, extensive testing |
| Blockchain network congestion | High | Implement retry logic and gas price strategy |
| User key loss | High | Provide key recovery options and education |
| ZKpass integration issues | Medium | Create fallback verification mechanism |
| Gas costs exceed budget | Medium | Optimize transactions and batch updates |

## Dependencies

- Completed identity verification system
- Ethereum/EVM development environment
- ZKpass API integration
- Wallet connection functionality
- Blockchain infrastructure provider
