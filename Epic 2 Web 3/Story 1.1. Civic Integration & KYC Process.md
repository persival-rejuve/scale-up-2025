# Story 1.1: Civic Integration & KYC Process

## Overview

This story covers the implementation of the Civic Uniqueness Pass integration and the Know Your Customer (KYC) process for the Rejuve Longevity App. The goal is to establish a lightweight verification system that proves users are real humans and prevents multiple account creation without requiring extensive personal information.

## Technical Details

### Civic Uniqueness Pass Integration

Civic's solution provides "proof of humanness" and unique identity verification through the following process:

1. **Face Verification**:
   - User takes a selfie within the app
   - Facial features are processed to create a unique biometric hash
   - Hash is checked against existing database to prevent duplicates

2. **Wallet Binding**:
   - Verification is cryptographically tied to user's blockchain wallet address
   - Creates 1:1 relationship between human identity and wallet

3. **Verification Token**:
   - Upon successful verification, Civic issues a verification token
   - Token serves as proof of verification without storing personal data

### KYC Screen Workflow

The UX flow for KYC screens includes:

1. **Introduction Screen**:
   - Explains purpose of verification
   - Details privacy protection measures
   - Outlines steps in the process

2. **Wallet Connection Screen**:
   - Options to connect existing wallet or create new one
   - Support for multiple wallet providers
   - Security guidance for wallet protection

3. **Civic Verification Screen**:
   - Face verification instructions
   - Camera access and selfie capture
   - Real-time verification status

4. **Consent Form Screen**:
   - Data usage terms presented in clear language
   - Granular permission options for different data types
   - Wallet signature request for consent verification

5. **Completion Screen**:
   - Verification confirmation
   - Next steps for Data NFT minting
   - Links to educational materials about verification

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend Components

- React Native / Flutter components for verification flow
- Camera integration for face verification
- Secure storage for verification tokens
- Wallet connection interface

### Backend Services

- Civic API integration service
- Verification status tracking database
- Consent management system
- Audit logging for verification events

### Wallet Integration

- WalletConnect protocol implementation
- Transaction signing for consent verification
- Wallet status management

## Privacy & Security Considerations

- Biometric data is processed but not stored long-term
- Verification results in privacy-preserving tokens only
- All communications with Civic servers use end-to-end encryption
- Compliance with GDPR and other privacy regulations
- Clear user consent for all data processing

## Testing Requirements

- Verification flow testing with multiple device types
- Duplicate account detection testing
- Edge cases (poor lighting, network issues, etc.)
- Penetration testing for security vulnerabilities
- Performance testing under load

## Acceptance Criteria

1. User can complete Civic verification in under 2 minutes
2. System successfully prevents creation of duplicate accounts
3. Verification status persists across app sessions
4. All screen flows meet accessibility standards
5. Full process works across iOS and Android platforms
6. System handles verification failures gracefully with clear user feedback
7. All user data is processed in compliance with privacy regulations

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Civic API changes | High | Establish webhook for API update notifications; build adapter layer |
| False rejections | Medium | Implement appeals process and manual verification backup |
| User confusion | Medium | Create clear help documentation and tooltips throughout process |
| Network failures | Medium | Implement robust retry logic and offline capability where possible |

## Dependencies

- Civic API access and credentials
- Wallet provider integrations
- Blockchain network connectivity
- UX designs for verification flow screens
