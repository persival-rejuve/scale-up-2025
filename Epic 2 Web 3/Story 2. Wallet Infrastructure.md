# Story 2: Wallet Infrastructure

## Overview

The Wallet Infrastructure component provides the foundation for blockchain interactions in the Rejuve Longevity App. It enables users to securely manage their digital assets, interact with Data NFTs, and claim RJV tokens through an intuitive interface that supports both novice and experienced crypto users.

## Business Value

- **User Accessibility**: Provides both traditional and keyless wallet options to accommodate users of all technical levels
- **Asset Security**: Ensures secure management of digital assets and private keys
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Enables interaction with multiple blockchain networks for broader ecosystem integration
- **Reward Distribution**: Facilitates efficient claiming and management of RJV tokens

## Current Status

Based on Jira data, this component is in planning stages:
- REJUVEL-3261 (Investigate keyless wallets) - To Do
- REJUVEL-3260 (Integrate actual wallets for claiming) - To Do
- REJUVEL-1667 (Investigate integration of Cardano token with App) - To Do
