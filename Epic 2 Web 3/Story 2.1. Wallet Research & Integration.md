## Technical Research

### Keyless Wallet Solutions

Research will evaluate the following keyless wallet options:

1. **Magic Link**
   - Email-based authentication with no seed phrase
   - SDK availability for React Native / Flutter
   - Security architecture and key management
   - Pricing model and scalability

2. **Privy**
   - Social login and email authentication options
   - Developer experience and integration complexity
   - Mobile support capabilities
   - Security practices and audits

3. **Web3Auth**
   - Multi-factor authentication options
   - Threshold key management system
   - Support for social logins and biometrics
   - Cross-chain compatibility

4. **Custom Implementation**
   - Server-side key management architecture
   - PIN/biometric authentication system
   - Recovery mechanism options
   - Development and maintenance costs

Evaluation criteria include:
- Security robustness
- User experience simplicity
- Mobile SDK quality
- Integration complexity
- Cost structure
- Scalability
- Compliance with regulations

### Traditional Wallet Integration

Implementation will focus on integrating established wallet solutions:

1. **MetaMask**
   - Deep linking implementation
   - Mobile SDK integration
   - Browser extension compatibility
   - Transaction signing flow

2. **WalletConnect**
   - Protocol v2.0 implementation
   - QR code scanning integration
   - Session management
   - Chain switching support

3. **Coinbase Wallet**
   - API integration details
   - Mobile deep linking
   - User authentication flow
   - Transaction approval process

## Technical Implementation

### Wallet Provider Abstraction Layer

To support multiple wallet types, the implementation will include:

1. **Provider Interface**
   - Abstract wallet provider interface
   - Standardized connection methods
   - Transaction signing protocols
   - Account management functions

2. **Connection Management**
   - Wallet detection and availability checks
   - Connection state persistence
   - Auto-reconnect functionality
   - Timeout and error handling

3. **Transaction Handling**
   - Transaction preparation
   - Gas estimation and optimization
   - Signature request formatting
   - Receipt processing and event emission

### Mobile-Specific Implementations

For iOS and Android platforms:

1. **Deep Linking**
   - URI scheme registration
   - App-to-app communication
   - Return URL handling
   - State management across app switches

2. **Secure Storage**
   - Encrypted storage for connection details
   - Biometric authentication integration
   - Key deletion on logout
   - Secure backup options

3. **Mobile UI Components**
   - Wallet selection interface
   - QR code scanner
   - Transaction confirmation screens
   - Wallet status indicators

## Implementation Steps

1. **Research Phase**
   - Evaluate keyless wallet solutions
   - Test integration with selected wallet providers
   - Document findings and recommendations
   - Select final approach based on criteria

2. **Architecture Design**
   - Design provider abstraction layer
   - Create connection flow diagrams
   - Define error handling strategies
   - Document security architecture

3. **Core Implementation**
   - Implement provider interfaces
   - Create connection management service
   - Develop transaction handling system
   - Build secure storage solution

4. **UI Development**
   - Design and implement wallet selection UI
   - Create wallet creation flow
   - Develop transaction signing screens
   - Build wallet management interface

5. **Testing**
   - Test connections with real wallets
   - Validate transaction signing process
   - Verify deep linking on all platforms
   - Stress test connection management

## User Experience Flow

### New User Flow (Keyless)
1. User chooses to create a wallet
2. Enters email address
3. Receives authentication code
4. Creates PIN for transactions
5. Completes wallet setup with education

### Existing Wallet Flow
1. User selects "Connect existing wallet"
2. Chooses provider (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
3. Completes connection process via deep link or QR code
4. Approves connection request in wallet app
5. Returns to Rejuve app with active connection

### Transaction Flow
1. User initiates action requiring transaction
2. Preview screen shows transaction details
3. User confirms transaction
4. External wallet opens for signing (or PIN entry for keyless)
5. Transaction confirmation and status tracking

## Security Considerations

- **Keyless Key Management**: Secure server-side storage of encrypted keys
- **Connection Security**: Secure channel for wallet communication
- **Transaction Signing**: Clear confirmation of transaction details
- **Session Management**: Secure timeout and reconnection policies
- **Phishing Prevention**: Clear wallet connection indicators
- **Recovery Processes**: Secure account recovery methods

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can successfully create keyless wallets with email and PIN
2. MetaMask and WalletConnect connections work reliably on all platforms
3. Transactions can be signed and tracked to completion
4. Connection state persists appropriately between sessions
5. Error states are handled gracefully with clear user feedback
6. Recovery processes are functional and secure
7. All security requirements pass third-party audit

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Keyless solution security vulnerabilities | Critical | Third-party security audit, encryption review |
| Deep linking inconsistencies across platforms | High | Extensive testing on all platforms and OS versions |
| Poor UX for non-crypto users | High | User testing with crypto novices, simplified flows |
| Wallet provider API changes | Medium | Abstraction layer, monitoring for updates |
| Transaction failures | Medium | Robust error handling and retry mechanisms |

## Dependencies

- Web3 provider libraries
- Mobile deep linking capabilities
- Secure storage implementation
- Selected keyless wallet provider API
- WalletConnect protocol library
