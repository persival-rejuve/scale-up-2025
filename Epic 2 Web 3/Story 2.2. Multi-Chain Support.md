# Story 2.2: Multi-Chain Support

## Overview

This story covers the implementation of multi-chain support in the Rejuve Longevity App to enable token operations across different blockchain networks. The primary focus is on adding Cardano support alongside existing Ethereum/EVM chain integration, providing users with flexibility in how they interact with RJV tokens.

## Technical Specifications

### Cardano Integration

Cardano integration will focus on supporting the RJV token on Cardano blockchain:

1. **Token Specifications**
   - RJV-ADA policy ID: 8cfd6893f5f6c1cc954cec1a0a1460841b74da6e7803820dde62bb78
   - Token standards compliance (Native tokens)
   - Metadata structure and storage

2. **Cardano SDK Integration**
   - Wallet address handling
   - Transaction building and signing
   - Fee calculation and management
   - Block explorer integration

3. **Transaction Types**
   - Token transfer operations
   - Multi-asset transactions
   - Metadata attachment
   - Smart contract interactions (if applicable)

### Multi-Chain Abstraction Layer

To provide a consistent interface across blockchain networks:

1. **Chain-Agnostic Interface**
   - Common transaction model
   - Unified address format handling
   - Standardized error handling
   - Network status monitoring

2. **Chain Switching**
   - User-controlled network selection
   - Automatic detection of appropriate chain
   - Chain-specific configuration management
   - Transaction routing logic

3. **Network Management**
   - Connection and reliability monitoring
   - Testnet/Mainnet environment switching
   - Network fee optimization
   - RPC endpoint redundancy

### Cross-Chain Asset Tracking

To maintain consistent asset representation across chains:

1. **Token Mapping**
   - Cross-chain token identifier mapping
   - Balance aggregation across chains
   - Canonical representation in UI
   - Chain-of-origin tracking

2. **Transaction History**
   - Unified transaction history view
   - Chain-specific transaction details
   - Cross-chain transaction linking
   - Export and reporting functions

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: EVM Chain Integration

1. **Chain Configuration**
   - Define supported EVM chains (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)
   - Configure RPC endpoints and block explorers
   - Set up chain switching mechanism
   - Implement gas optimization strategies

2. **Transaction Handling**
   - Standardize transaction preparation
   - Implement gas estimation across chains
   - Create unified receipt processing
   - Build transaction status monitoring

3. **Testing**
   - Test with multiple EVM-compatible networks
   - Validate gas estimation accuracy
   - Verify transaction success rate
   - Assess network switching reliability

### Phase 2: Cardano Integration

1. **Cardano SDK Integration**
   - Evaluate and integrate Cardano SDK options
   - Implement wallet address handling
   - Build transaction construction system
   - Create fee estimation algorithm

2. **RJV-ADA Support**
   - Implement token policy verification
   - Create token transfer functionality
   - Build balance checking mechanism
   - Develop metadata handling

3. **Testing**
   - Test token operations on testnet
   - Validate transaction structures
   - Verify fee calculations
   - Assess transaction confirmation times

### Phase 3: Unified Experience

1. **Chain-Agnostic Interface**
   - Implement abstraction layer
   - Create unified transaction model
   - Standardize address handling
   - Build error normalization

2. **UI Integration**
   - Develop network selection interface
   - Create uniform transaction screens
   - Build chain-aware balance display
   - Implement network status indicators

3. **Testing**
   - End-to-end testing across chains
   - User experience validation
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Reliability assessment

## Technical Challenges

1. **Protocol Differences**:
   - Account vs. UTXO model differences
   - Transaction structure variations
   - Fee mechanism disparities
   - Address format incompatibilities

2. **Performance Variations**:
   - Different confirmation times
   - Varying fee markets
   - Network congestion handling
   - RPC endpoint reliability

3. **Maintenance Complexity**:
   - Multiple SDK dependencies
   - Chain-specific bug fixes
   - Network upgrade handling
   - Testing across multiple networks

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can view and manage RJV tokens on both EVM chains and Cardano
2. Chain switching is intuitive and error-resistant
3. Transaction success rate exceeds 99% across all supported chains
4. Unified transaction history shows operations from all chains
5. Error messages are clear and chain-specific when necessary
6. System gracefully handles network-specific issues
7. Performance remains consistent regardless of chosen chain
