# Epic 2: Web3 Integration Summary

## Executive Overview

The Web3 Integration Epic focuses on incorporating blockchain technology into the Rejuve Longevity App to enhance data ownership, provide token-based incentives, and create a secure ecosystem for health data management. This initiative transforms the app from a traditional health tracking platform into a Web3-enabled ecosystem where users have true ownership of their health data and can participate in a token economy.

## Implementation Timeline

This epic requires a focused 3-month implementation period:

- **Preparation Phase** (Current - July): App improvements and planning
- **Implementation Phase** (July - October): 100% focus on Web3 integration
- **Refinement Phase** (Post-October): Optimization and expansion

## Key Components

### 1. DataNFT & Unique User Verification

**Purpose**: Establish a blockchain-based identity system where each user receives a unique Data NFT that serves as their network membership token and manages their data ownership.

**Key Features**:
- Civic Uniqueness Pass integration for identity verification
- Data NFT minting and management
- ZKpass integration for private data verification
- Admin and user dashboards for permission management

**Jira Tickets**: REJUVEL-1669, REJUVEL-2898, REJUVEL-2904, REJUVEL-2737

**Implementation Priority**: High (Phase 1)

### 2. Wallet Infrastructure

**Purpose**: Provide secure wallet functionality for blockchain interactions, enabling both novice and experienced users to manage digital assets and interact with Web3 features.

**Key Features**:
- Keyless wallet solutions for non-crypto users
- Integration with traditional wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect)
- Multi-chain support (Ethereum/EVM chains + Cardano)
- Secure transaction management

**Jira Tickets**: REJUVEL-3261, REJUVEL-3260, REJUVEL-1667

**Implementation Priority**: High (Phase 1)

### 3. Token Economics & Rewards

**Purpose**: Establish RJV token as the incentive mechanism in the ecosystem, rewarding users for data contributions and enabling partner interactions.

**Key Features**:
- Token distribution mechanisms
- Partner classification system (standard/exclusive)
- Single-use code redemption
- Token persistence across devices

**Jira Tickets**: REJUVEL-3236, REJUVEL-3177, REJUVEL-2866, REJUVEL-3447

**Implementation Priority**: Medium (Phase 1-2)

### 4. Web3 User Education

**Purpose**: Create accessible onboarding and learning resources to help users understand Web3 concepts and interact confidently with blockchain features.

**Key Features**:
- Introductory Web3 experience
- Mini-courses on blockchain, NFTs, wallets
- Interactive tutorials and simulations
- Safety guidelines and best practices

**Jira Tickets**: REJUVEL-2751

**Implementation Priority**: Medium (Phase 2)

### 5. Technical Infrastructure

**Purpose**: Optimize blockchain services and APIs to ensure reliable performance, scalability, and maintainability of Web3 integration.

**Key Features**:
- Concurrent blockchain call support
- API enhancements for token features
- User service refactoring
- Monitoring and analytics for blockchain operations

**Jira Tickets**: REJUVEL-1308, REJUVEL-3447, REJUVEL-3110

**Implementation Priority**: High (Phase 1)
