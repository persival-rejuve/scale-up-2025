# Story 1: DataNFT & Unique User Verification

## Overview

The DataNFT & Unique User Verification component is the cornerstone of the Rejuve Longevity App's Web3 integration. It establishes a secure, blockchain-based identity system where each user receives a unique Data NFT that serves as their membership token in the network and manages their data ownership and permissions.

## Business Value

- **Unique Identity**: Ensures each user has only one account, preventing gaming of the reward system
- **Data Ownership**: Gives users true ownership of their health data through blockchain verification
- **Permission Management**: Creates a transparent framework for data usage permissions
- **Reward Eligibility**: Establishes clear qualification for RJV token rewards based on data contributions

## Current Status

Based on Jira data, this component is partially implemented:
- REJUVEL-1669 (Integration of Data NFT with App) - In Progress
- REJUVEL-2898 (UX for Wallet & KYC screens) - In Progress
- REJUVEL-2904 (Experiment Data NFT creation) - In Progress
- REJUVEL-2737 (Integrate Civic Uniqueness Pass) - To Do

## Technical Requirements

### User Flow

1. **Proof of Human Verification** (Civic Uniqueness Pass)
   - User completes face verification tied to wallet address
   - Verification confirms user is a real human and has only one account

2. **Wallet Connection**
   - User connects existing wallet or creates new wallet
   - App establishes secure connection with wallet

3. **Data Consent & NFT Minting**
   - User reviews and accepts data usage terms
   - Signs consent form using wallet transaction
   - Data NFT is minted and assigned to user's wallet

4. **ZKpass Integration**
   - Age/gender/location verification without exposing actual data
   - Creates zero-knowledge proofs of user attributes

### Admin Dashboard Requirements

- Data permission management interface
- User verification status tracking
- NFT minting logs and status monitoring
- Permission change auditing

## Implementation Challenges

1. **Technical Complexity**:
   - Smart contract development and security
   - Integration with multiple verification services
   - Cross-platform wallet compatibility

2. **User Experience**:
   - Simplifying complex blockchain processes for non-technical users
   - Creating intuitive consent flows
   - Ensuring transparency in data usage

3. **Security & Compliance**:
   - Ensuring GDPR compliance with blockchain data
   - Securing private keys and wallet access
   - Preventing identity spoofing or verification bypasses

## Dependencies

- Civic Uniqueness Pass API integration
- ZKpass API integration
- Blockchain infrastructure (Ethereum/EVM)
- Smart contract development and auditing
