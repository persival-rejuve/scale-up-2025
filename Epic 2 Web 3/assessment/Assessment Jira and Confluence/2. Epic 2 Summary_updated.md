## Key Areas of Focus

### 1. Identity & Verification (Data NFT)
- Core focus on **Data NFT as identity token** (REJUVEL-1669)
- Integration with **Civic Uniqueness Pass** (REJUVEL-2737)
- Light KYC process to prevent multiple user accounts per person
- Experiments with Data NFT creation process (REJUVEL-2904)

### 2. Wallet Infrastructure
- Research on **keyless wallet solutions** (REJUVEL-3261)
- Integration with **multiple wallet providers** (REJUVEL-3260)
- UX flow design for wallet connectivity (REJUVEL-2898)
- Multi-chain support exploration, including **Cardano** integration (REJUVEL-1667)

### 3. Token Economics & Rewards
- RJV token distribution and claiming mechanisms
- Partner integrations for token rewards
- Single-use code redemption with RJV tokens (REJUVEL-3236)
- Exclusive RJV partner program (REJUVEL-3177)

### 4. User Education
- Comprehensive **Web 3.0 onboarding experience** (REJUVEL-2751)
- Educational content about blockchain, NFTs, and crypto wallets
- Safety and security guidance for crypto newcomers

### 5. Technical Infrastructure
- Optimization of blockchain service calls (REJUVEL-1308)
- API enhancements for token-related features (REJUVEL-2866)
- User service refactoring for token management (REJUVEL-3447)

## Implementation Challenges

### User Experience Issues
Several bugs relate to token persistence problems:
- **Token loss after app reinstallation** (REJUVEL-2583)
- **Token disappearance after device upgrades** (REJUVEL-2458)
- Blocked tokens vanishing (REJUVEL-2554)

These suggest a need for improved token storage architecture, possibly with better synchronization to blockchain or secure cloud backup of wallet/token state.

### Technical Debt & Integration Hurdles
- Payment gateway integration complexity (REJUVEL-1513)
- Concurrent blockchain operations (REJUVEL-1308)
- Multi-chain support challenges (supporting both EVM chains and Cardano)

## Proposed Roadmap for Epic 2

Based on the priority and status of existing issues, the following implementation sequence is recommended:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Next 1-2 Sprints)
1. Complete UX for Wallet & KYC screens (REJUVEL-2898)
2. Finalize RJV partner API implementation (REJUVEL-3177)
3. Deploy single-use code RJV pricing (REJUVEL-3236)
4. Complete refactoring of user service (REJUVEL-3447)

### Phase 2: Core Integration (Next Quarter)
1. Complete Data NFT integration (REJUVEL-1669)
2. Implement keyless wallet solutions (REJUVEL-3261)
3. Integrate Civic Uniqueness Pass (REJUVEL-2737)
4. Complete wallet claim functionality (REJUVEL-3260)

### Phase 3: Expansion & Education (3-6 Months Out)
1. Launch Web 3.0 onboarding experience (REJUVEL-2751)
2. Implement Cardano integration (REJUVEL-1667)
3. Optimize blockchain concurrent processing (REJUVEL-1308)
4. Develop on/off-ramp for private wallets (REJUVEL-673)

## Integration with Other Epics

The Web3 functionality in Epic 2 has potential touchpoints with other areas of the application:

1. **Data Management & Privacy**: Integration with data consent mechanisms and privacy controls through the Data NFT
2. **Rewards & Gamification**: Connection to the rewards system for incentivizing healthy behaviors
3. **Partner Ecosystem**: Integration with the partner network for token-based rewards and exclusive offers

## Technical Architecture Recommendations

1. **Token Storage**: Implement hybrid storage solution combining local secure storage with blockchain verification
2. **Multi-chain Support**: Build abstraction layer to support multiple blockchains (ETH/BSC/Polygon + Cardano)
3. **Wallet Integration**: Support both custodial (keyless) and non-custodial wallet options
4. **Smart Contract Security**: Implement thorough audit and verification process for all smart contracts

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize ongoing work**: Focus on completing the in-progress and QA items
2. **Technical architecture review**: Convene technical team to review and refine the Web3 architecture
3. **User research**: Gather feedback on the proposed wallet and token UX from beta testers
4. **Coordination with partners**: Align with partner companies on token economics and reward mechanisms
