I'll analyze Jasmine's new Slack message about the DataNFT & Unique User Verification requirements and compare it against our previous comprehensive assessment to determine what's already covered and what's missing.Now let me also check the existing Epics to understand the current structure:Let me check the related tickets mentioned in the Confluence document:Now let me create a comprehensive analysis of Jasmine's new Slack message about the DataNFT & Unique User Verification specs.

## Jasmine on Slack

`Hi just catching up in regards to KYC & Wallet things---this is actually a massive epic that will require a lot of attention once we can begin it, since its a key infrastructural piece to our overall protocol/plan.I made a documentation page covering the requirements here:  

[https://rejuve-ai.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RL/pages/6389761/DataNFT+Unique+User+Verification+Specs](https://rejuve-ai.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RL/pages/6389761/DataNFT+Unique+User+Verification+Specs)

Proper workload division and management will be key to making sure we keep a good cadence on this while not neglecting other smaller app features/improvements.

If we need "all hands on deck" in order to complete this project timely (i.e. with a fixed timeline that is predictable and not prone to drift) then we do that and stop development on all other features...

That's not the ideal but we really can't drag this epic into next year. Intuitively I believe this work can be achieved in about 3 months if we focus exclusively on it.So for example from now until July (RAADfest) we work on fixing up the current app and making it a bit nicer. 

Then mid/late July we start 100% focus on this project to have it completed & tested by October. Feel free to add other team members to this channel as needed.

## üìã **My Understanding & Analysis**

Based on my analysis of Jasmine's new Slack message and comparing it to our comprehensive assessment from the attached files, here's what I understand about her requirements:

### **üéØ Understanding Jasmine's New Perspective:**

Jasmine recognizes that the **KYC & Wallet Integration** is actually a **"massive epic"** that requires significant attention and proper workload management. Her new message reveals several key insights:

1. **Scale Recognition**: This is not just a few tasks, but a major infrastructural piece
2. **Timeline Concern**: She cannot let this drag into next year
3. **Focus Strategy**: Suggests **3 months of exclusive focus** for completion
4. **Phase Approach**: App improvements until July, then 100% focus July-October
5. **Documentation Created**: New comprehensive specs document created

---

## üîç **What's Already Covered in Our Previous Assessment:**

### **‚úÖ WELL COVERED AREAS:**

**1. Basic Framework & Foundation (From Documents 5 & 5.1):**

- We identified that DataNFT Registration was **Requirement #1** in our comprehensive mapping
- We already mapped it to **Epic: Web 3.0 Onboarding Experience (REJUVEL-2751)**
- Related issues already identified: REJUVEL-1669, REJUVEL-2898, REJUVEL-2737

**2. Technical Flow Understanding (From Documents 2 & 3):**

- ‚úÖ 4-step process already documented in our analysis
- ‚úÖ Civic "Proof of Human" integration mapped to REJUVEL-2737
- ‚úÖ Wallet connection flows documented
- ‚úÖ DataNFT minting process identified

**3. Confluence Documentation (From Document 2):** We had already found extensive related documentation:

- DataNFT/Unique User Verification Specs ‚úÖ
- Flutter wallet connector integration ‚úÖ
- Data NFT Dashboard Specs ‚úÖ
- Identity Verification specs ‚úÖ

## üö® **What's NEW or NOT FULLY COVERED:**

### **üî¥ CRITICAL GAPS REVEALED BY NEW MESSAGE:**

**1. Epic Structure Misalignment:**

- **Problem**: Our assessment shows REJUVEL-1669 under "**Decentralized Identity Verification**" Epic (REJUVEL-672)
- **Problem**: REJUVEL-2898 is under "**Design Fixes**" Epic (REJUVEL-2599)
- **Need**: Jasmine's message suggests this should be **ONE massive dedicated Epic**

**2. New Confluence Specifications:**

- **New Document**: DataNFT/Unique User Verification Specs (Page 6389761) was **NOT** in our previous analysis
- **Additional Requirements**: ZKpass integration for data verification mentioned in new doc
- **Admin Panel Requirements**: Dashboard needs mentioned in new specs

**3. Scale & Timeline Misunderstanding:**

- **Previous View**: Multiple smaller issues across different epics
- **Jasmine's Reality**: This is a **3-month exclusive focus project**
- **Gap**: We underestimated the scope and integration complexity

**4. Missing Components from New Confluence Doc:**

Based on the retrieved Confluence document, **NEW requirements** include:

- **Step 4**: Sign consent form with wallet transaction (not previously documented)
- **ZKpass Integration**: Additional verification layer for data integrity
- **Admin Panel/Dashboard**: Management interface for data permissions
- **User Dashboard**: App user interface for data permission management
- **Wallet Creation**: Research needed for new wallet creation (not just connection)

---

## üìä **Updated Epic & Task Structure Needed:**

### **üîÑ RECOMMENDED RESTRUCTURING:**

**1. Create New Master Epic:**

```
"DataNFT & Unique User Verification System" 
(This becomes the "massive epic" Jasmine referenced)
```

**2. Move Existing Issues Under New Epic:**

- REJUVEL-1669 (Integration of Data NFT with App)
- REJUVEL-2898 (UX for Wallet & KYC screens)
- REJUVEL-2737 (Integrate Civic Uniqueness Pass)

**3. Create Missing Stories/Tasks:**

**Story: ZKpass Integration**

- Task: Research ZKpass API integration
- Task: Implement age/gender/location verification
- Task: Design verification UI flows

**Story: Consent Form & Wallet Signing**

- Task: Design consent form interface
- Task: Implement wallet signature verification
- Task: Create transaction confirmation flows

**Story: Admin Panel & Dashboards**

- Task: Design admin data management interface
- Task: Implement user data permissions dashboard
- Task: Create data usage tracking features

**Story: Wallet Creation Research**

- Task: Research wallet creation solutions
- Task: Evaluate keyless wallet options
- Task: Design wallet creation vs connection flows

---

## ‚úÖ **What IS Already Covered:**

1. **Technical Infrastructure**: Smart contracts and blockchain integration documented
2. **Basic UI/UX Flow**: REJUVEL-2898 covers wallet & KYC screen design
3. **Civic Integration**: REJUVEL-2737 addresses "proof of human" requirements
4. **Core Data NFT Functionality**: REJUVEL-1669 handles basic integration

## üö® **What's NOT Covered:**

1. **Epic Structure**: No single "massive epic" encompassing all requirements
2. **ZKpass Integration**: Additional verification layer not previously identified
3. **Consent Form Signing**: Wallet signature requirement not documented
4. **Admin/User Dashboards**: Management interfaces not planned
5. **Wallet Creation**: Research and implementation not scoped
6. **Timeline & Resource Planning**: 3-month exclusive focus not reflected in current structure

---

## üéØ **Immediate Action Plan:**

1. **Create the "Massive Epic"** as Jasmine described
2. **Reorganize existing issues** under the new epic structure
3. **Create missing Stories/Tasks** for ZKpass, consent forms, dashboards
4. **Update timeline estimates** to reflect 3-month scope
5. **Plan resource allocation** for "100% focus" approach

This analysis shows that while we had good foundational understanding, Jasmine's new message reveals the true scale and additional requirements that transform this from multiple small features into one major infrastructural project.
