### Prompt 


Understand this information about the previous chat that we had at the attached files.

We wanna make sure if we have mentioned it into this plan about this requirement described into the message below by Jasmine Smith.

Tell me if what she mentions is already covered into the attached content.

Check the document into Confluence [https://rejuve-ai.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RL/pages/6389761/DataNFT+Unique+User+Verification+Specs](https://rejuve-ai.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RL/pages/6389761/DataNFT+Unique+User+Verification+Specs)

Maybe it can be a brand new Epic or a story or tasks into existing Epics and by my superficial understanding it seems that it must start with the UI/UX design, but we must be sure about all the necessary tasks.

The main focus here is to access the message below after read the document in Confluence,

Confirm all the tasks into the epics in Jira, and then compare with this already done assessment into the attached files.

To tell me if it's already covered in there or not and what is not covered

Here follows the message from Jasmine on Slack:

Hi just catching up in regards to KYC & Wallet things---this is actually a massive epic that will require a lot of attention once we can begin it, since its a key infrastructural piece to our overall protocol/plan.I made a documentation page covering the requirements here:[https://rejuve-ai.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RL/pages/6389761/DataNFT+Unique+User+Verification+SpecsProper](https://rejuve-ai.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RL/pages/6389761/DataNFT+Unique+User+Verification+SpecsProper) workload division and management will be key to making sure we keep a good cadence on this while not neglecting other smaller app features/improvements. If we need "all hands on deck" in order to complete this project timely (i.e. with a fixed timeline that is predictable and not prone to drift) then we do that and stop development on all other features...That's not the ideal but we really can't drag this epic into next year. Intuitively I believe this work can be achieved in about 3 months if we focus exclusively on it.So for example from now until July (RAADfest) we work on fixing up the current app and making it a bit nicer. Then mid/late July we start 100% focus on this project to have it completed & tested by October. Feel free to add other team members to this channel as needed.
