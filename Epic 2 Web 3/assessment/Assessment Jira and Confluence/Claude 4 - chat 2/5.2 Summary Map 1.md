I've created a comprehensive table that maps all the requirements from Jasmine's chat to existing and missing Jira issues with their corresponding Confluence documentation.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Insights from the Table:**

### **âœ… What's Well Covered:**

- **DataNFT Registration:** Strong technical documentation exists, multiple issues in progress
- **Basic Wallet Integration:** Research and specs available, some issues active
- **RJV Store Integration:** API work in QA phase with good documentation

### **ðŸš¨ Critical Gaps Identified:**

**6 Missing Epics Needed:**

1. **Data NFT Infrastructure Epic** (to properly group REJUVEL-1669 and related)
2. **Multi-chain Token Infrastructure Epic**
3. **Claim-to-Stake Infrastructure Epic**
4. **AGIX Integration & Airdrops Epic**
5. **Survey Refresh & Intervention Tracking Epic**
6. **Cross-Platform Wallet Solutions Epic**

**20+ Missing Issues** across critical areas like:

- Security verification for device theft
- Balance management logic (app first, then wallet)
- Direct claim-to-stake functionality
- AGIX airdrop mechanisms
- PC-only crypto user solutions
- Survey refresh timer systems

### **ðŸ“‹ Immediate Actions Required:**

1. **Create the 6 missing Epics** to properly organize the work
2. **Develop technical specifications** for missing Confluence documentation
3. **Create and estimate the 20+ missing issues**
4. **Align current issues** under proper Epic hierarchy
5. **Prioritize based on Jasmine's 4-phase vision**

This table provides a complete roadmap showing exactly what exists, what's missing, and what needs to be created to fully implement Jasmine's strategic vision for the blockchain and Web3 integration.
