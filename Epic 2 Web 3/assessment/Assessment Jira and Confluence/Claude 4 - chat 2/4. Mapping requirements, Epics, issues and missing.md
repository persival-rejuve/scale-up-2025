I understand what you want me to create. Let me explain the table structure before proceeding:

## ðŸ“‹ **Table Structure Explanation:**

### **Columns:**

1. **Requirement** - High-level requirement from Jasmine's chat
2. **Epic** - Epic name
3. **Jira Link to Epic** - Direct link to the Epic
4. **Link to Confluence Doc** - Specific documentation (multiple rows if multiple docs)
5. **Issue Type** - Task/Story/Sub-task/Bug
6. **Issue Number** - REJUVEL-XXXX
7. **Issue Status** - Current status (or "MISSING" for gaps)
8. **Jira Link to Issue** - Direct link to the issue
9. **Additional Confluence Docs** - More documentation if applicable

### **Logic:**

- **Multiple Confluence docs** = New row with same Epic/Requirement info
- **Multiple Issues per Epic** = New row with same Epic info but different issue details
- **Missing Issues** = Status shows "MISSING" with explanation
- **Excluded** = "Won't Do" status issues are omitted

### **Requirements from Jasmine's Chat:**

1. **DataNFT Registration** (Civic + NFT minting)
2. **RJV Token Claiming** (Wallet verification + security)
3. **Survey Refresh Timers** (3-4 month updates)
4. **Claim-to-Stake Integration**
5. **AGIX Airdrop Phase II**
6. **Mobile vs PC Wallet Solutions**
7. **Security for Device Theft**
8. **Balance Management Logic** (App first, then wallet)

### **Current Epics:**

- Web 3.0 Onboarding Experience (REJUVEL-2751)
- On-off Ramp for Private Wallets (REJUVEL-673)
- **MISSING**: Claim-to-Stake Integration Epic
- **MISSING**: Survey Refresh System Epic

### **Approach:**

1. Start with existing requirements and map to current Epics/Issues
2. Add rows for missing Epics/Issues with "MISSING" status
3. Include all relevant Confluence documentation
4. Organize by logical flow (following Jasmine's 4-phase vision)
