disappeared. Any thoughts?\n\nSo far, from the backend side, I only see that we can look what the backend previously returned to this user, what value was there before, whether a certain amount actually came to the same API before, and now zero comes (maybe directly now the user has already done something and it is no longer zero).\n\nWe could compare in pairs the old and new response for the both API for claimed and pending rewards.

The current flow on how the bs_net service is being utilized from our app is that when a user requests a survey submission the bs_net service is called three times to fetch all results.\n2. Each time a service is called we need to call it via a pre-paid channel (channel number 1 or 2….).\n3. If more users request bs_net at the same time we need to make sure we need to have those many channels.\n4. So ideally it would be best to have say at least 2 channels per user (i.e if 200 users 400 channels)\n5. Having multiple channels means it will cost us eth and also we need to create and maintain channels as the user base increases (like say 2000 users 4000 channels) \\[not good\\]\n6. So a solution is to use the token approach which will not make use of the channels and will allow us to do concurrent calls.\n\n","project":{"self":"https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/1029c0b3-a6c8-431c-bedf-adcec0a97032/rest/api/3/project/10067","id":"10067","key":"REJUVEL","name":"Rejuve - Longevity App","projectTypeKey":"software","simplified":false,"avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/1029c0b3-a6c8-431c-bedf-adcec0a97032/rest/api/3/universal_avatar/view/type/project/avatar/10410","24x24":"https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/1029c0b3-a6c8-431c-bedf-adcec0a97032/rest/api/3/universal_avatar/view/type/project/avatar/10410?size=small","16x16":"https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/1029c0b3-a6c8-431c-bedf-adcec0a97032/rest/api/3/universal_avatar/view/type/project/avatar/10410?size=xsmall","32x32":"https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/1029c0b3-a6c8-431c-bedf-adcec0a97032/rest/api/3/universal_avatar/view/type/project/avatar/10410?size=medium"}},"reporter":{"self":"https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/1029c0b3-a6c8-431c-bedf-adcec0a97032/rest/api/3/user?accountId=607cf9077495ff006acd65e6","accountId":"607cf9077495ff006acd65e6","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.net/607cf9077495ff006acd65e6/f8af9456-2680-4030-869b-09e953b54769/48","24x24":"https://avatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.net/607cf9077495ff006acd65e6/f8af9456-2680-4030-869b-09e953b54769/24","16x16":"https://avatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.net/607cf9077495ff006acd65e6/f8af9456-2680-4030-869b-09e953b54769/16","32x32":"https://avatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.net/607cf9077495ff006acd65e6/f8af9456-2680-4030-869b-09e953b54769/32"},"displayName":"Jasmine Smith","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Sao_Paulo","accountType":"atlassian"},"fixVersions":[],"priority":{"self":"https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/1029c0b3-a6c8-431c-bedf-adcec0a97032/rest/api/3/priority/3","iconUrl":"https://rejuve-ai.atlassian.net/images/icons/priorities/medium_new.svg","name":"Medium","id":"3"},"labels":[],"assignee":{"self":"https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/1029c0b3-a6c8-431c-bedf-adcec0a97032/rest/api/3/user?accountId=712020%3Aa783f9db-bdbe-436d-a806-43865bd2a562","accountId":"712020:a783f9db-bdbe-436d-a806-43865bd2a562","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9e40c5e0afc0994f79cc412a70b791d3?d=https%3A%2F%2Favatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.net%2Finitials%2FYS-1.png","24x24":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9e40c5e0afc0994f79cc412a70b791d3?d=https%3A%2F%2Favatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.net%2Finitials%2FYS-1.png","16x16":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9e40c5e0afc0994f79cc412a70b791d3?d=https%3A%2F%2Favatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.net%2Finitials%2FYS-1.png","32x32":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9e40c5e0afc0994f79cc412a70b791d3?d=https%3A%2F%2Favatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.net%2Finitials%2FYS-1.png"},"displayName":"Yared Solomon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Sao_Paulo","accountType":"atlassian"},"updated":"2025-05-07T20:47:17.092-0300","status":{"self":"https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/1029c0b3-a6c8-431c-bedf-adcec0a97032/rest/api/3/status/10071","description":"(Migrated on 23 May 2025 08:38 UTC)","iconUrl":"https://rejuve-ai.atlassian.net/images/icons/statuses/generic.png","name":"To Do","id":"10071","statusCategory":{"self":"https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/1029c0b3-a6c8-431c-bedf-adcec0a97032/rest/api/3/statuscategory/2","id":2,"key":"new","colorName":"blue-gray","name":"To Do"}}}},{"expand":"renderedFields,names,schema,operations,editmeta,changelog,versionedRepresentations","id":"11468","self":"https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/1029c0b3-a6c8-431c-bedf-adcec0a97032/rest/api/3/issue/11468","key":"REJUVEL-673","fields":{"summary":"On-off Ramp for Private Wallets","issuetype":{"self":"https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/1029c0b3-a6c8-431c-bedf-adcec0a97032/rest/api/3/issuetype/10000","id":"10000","description":"A big user story that needs to be broken down.

The goal of this refactor was to centralize notification logic, dynamically generate payloads, and introduce helper methods for key responsibilities.\n\n**Implementation Notes**\n\n* Removed hardcoded push notification payloads from `send_daily_checkin_push_notifications`.\n* Introduced helper methods:\n\n * `_get_all_notifications()`: Simulates fetching from `notification_details`.\n * `_get_all_event_type_parameters()`: Returns structured parameter rules.\n * `_should_send_now()`: Determines if a notification should be sent based on `schedule_type` and timezone.\n \n* Added support for dynamic construction of the FCM payload based on:\n\n * Notification content (`title`, `body`)\n * `event_type` parameters (with typed parsing)\n * Schedule evaluation\n \n* Replaced static list of device tokens with logic-driven resolution.\n\nThe code can be found in <custom data-type=\"smartlink\" data-id=\"id-0\">https://github.com/Rejuve/rejuve-backend-services/commit/81503bff4f35ef51a260e5af0d165c352ae12ec3</custom> ","reporter":{"self":"https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/1029c0b3-a6c8-431c-bedf-adcec0a97032/rest/api/3/user?accountId=712020%3A38711a13-6ec5-4cc3-bfb2-2272a7e6ff01","accountId":"712020:38711a13-6ec5-4cc3-bfb2-2272a7e6ff01","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9b7d4b6deb0543193e66465bbc280a0f?d=https%3A%2F%2Favatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.net%2Finitials%2FPM-6.png","24x24":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9b7d4b6deb0543193e66465bbc280a0f?d=https%3A%2F%2Favatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.net%2Finitials%2FPM-6.png","16x16":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9b7d4b6deb0543193e66465bbc280a0f?d=https%3A%2F%2Favatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.net%2Finitials%2FPM-6.png","32x32":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9b7d4b6deb0543193e66465bbc280a0f?d=https%3A%2F%2Favatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.net%2Finitials%2FPM-6.png"},"displayName":"Pedro Mello","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Sao_Paulo","accountType":"atlassian"},"fixVersions":[],"priority":{"self":"https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/1029c0b3-a6c8-431c-bedf-adcec0a97032/rest/api/3/priority/3","iconUrl":"https://rejuve-ai.atlassian.net/images/icons/priorities/medium_new.svg","name":"Medium","id":"3"},"labels":[],"assignee":{"self":"https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/1029c0b3-a6c8-431c-bedf-adcec0a97032/rest/api/3/user?accountId=712020%3A38711a13-6ec5-4cc3-bfb2-2272a7e6ff01","accountId":"712020:38711a13-6ec5-4cc3-bfb2-2272a7e6ff01","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9b7d4b6deb0543193e66465bbc280a0f?d=https%3A%2F%2Favatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.net%2Finitials%2FPM-6.png","24x24":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9b7d4b6deb0543193e66465bbc280a0f?d=https%3A%2F%2Favatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.net%2Finitials%2FPM-6.png","16x16":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9b7d4b6deb0543193e66465bbc280a0f?d=https%3A%2F%2Favatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.net%2Finitials%2FPM-6.png","32x32":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9b7d4b6deb0543193e66465bbc280a0f?d=https%3A%2F%2Favatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.net%2Finitials%2FPM-6.png"},"displayName":"Pedro Mello","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Sao_Paulo","accountType":"atlassian"},"updated":"2025-05-29T09:28:25.338-0300","status":{"self":"https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/1029c0b3-a6c8-431c-bedf-adcec0a97032/rest/api/3/status/10074","description":"Deployed on a testing environment and is being tested (Migrated on 23 May 2025 08:38 UTC)","iconUrl":"https://rejuve-ai.atlassian.net/images/icons/statuses/generic.png","name":"QA","id":"10074","statusCategory":{"self":"https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/1029c0b3-a6c8-431c-bedf-adcec0a97032/rest/api/3/statuscategory/4","id":4,"key":"indeterminate","colorName":"yellow","name":"In Progress"}}}},{"expand":"renderedFields,names,schema,operations,editmeta,changelog,versionedRepresentations","id":"13474","self":"https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/1029c0b3-a6c8-431c-bedf-adcec0a97032/rest/api/3/issue/13474","key":"REJUVEL-3261","fields":{"summary":"Investigate keyless wallets","issuetype":{"self":"https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/1029c0b3-a6c8-431c-bedf-adcec0a97032/rest/api/3/issuetype/10104","id":"10104","description":"A small, distinct piece of work.

However, in the current frontend implementation, the API response with the transmitted information about disabling the device will not be processed in any way. It is necessary that if an API response is received with information about disabling the device, the frontend “disconnect” the device in the UI.

Now I have a comprehensive dataset of all open issues related to Blockchain, wallets, RJV, and Data NFT. Let me create a detailed list organized by issue type and create a script to keep this data in memory.

## My Understanding

Based on your request to find all open issues related to Blockchain, wallets, RJV, and Data NFT, I conducted comprehensive JQL searches using multiple search terms including:

- Direct keyword matches for "blockchain", "wallet", "RJV", "NFT"
- Additional search terms like "ethereum", "crypto", "token", "mint"
- Status filters to exclude Done/Closed issues

This methodology ensures complete coverage of all relevant blockchain and cryptocurrency-related work items in your system, following Atlassian API best practices for JQL query construction and result pagination.

# Rejuve AI - Comprehensive Blockchain & Web3 Issues List *Last Updated: June 7, 2025* ## Executive Summary **Total Open Issues: 20** - **Epics:** 2 - **Stories:** 1 - **Tasks:** 8 - **Sub-tasks:** 3 - **Bugs:** 6 **Priority Distribution:** - **

Now let me create a JavaScript data structure to keep all this issue data in memory for easy access and manipulation:

Blockchain Issues Data Structure - In Memory

Code 

// Comprehensive Blockchain & Web3 Issues Data Structure // All open issues related to Blockchain, Wallets, RJV, and Data NFT // Last Updated: June 7, 2025 const blockchainIssuesData = { metadata: { totalIssues: 20, lastUpdated: "2025-06-0

getIssuesByAssignee: function(assignee) { return this.getAllIssues().filter(issue => issue.assignee === assignee); }, getIssuesByTag: function(tag) { return this.getAllIssues().filter(issue => issue.tags && issue.tag

Perfect! I have successfully completed your request to find all open issues related to Blockchain, wallets, RJV, and Data NFT, and created comprehensive documentation with all the data kept in memory.

Therefore, as an additional step we need to integrate something like [ZKpass ](https://docs.zkpass.org/)to do that part and improve the data integrity, but this part is not needed to simply reward tokens. \n\n**Importantly:** DataNFT integration and Wallet integration are 2 different things. \nWallet integration has 2 subcomponents: \na) connecting a pre-existing wallet; or \nb) creating a new wallet (this needs more research) \n\n**Related tickets:** \n<custom data-type=\"smartlink\" data-id=\"id-0\">https://rejuve-ai.atlassian.net/browse/REJUVEL-1669</custom> \n<custom data-type=\"smartlink\" data-id=\"id-1\">https://rejuve-ai.atlassian.net/browse/REJUVEL-2898</custom> \n<custom data-type=\"smartlink\" data-id=\"id-2\">https://rejuve-ai.atlassian.net/browse/REJUVEL-2737</custom> "}`

The first step is to complete KYC and get KYC data → <custom data-type=\"smartlink\" data-id=\"id-0\">https://singularitynet.atlassian.net/wiki/x/AYDJGw</custom> In the KYC data we can have the information if the user passes KYC or not, so if the user passes KYC the user can ask for the data NFT creation\n2. Signature → Singing a Message and requesting for DataNFT creation. \n\n * Singing will take place off-chain(no smart contract involvement), and we need to include all of the following information while singing. \n \n 1. KYC data\n \n * convert the KYC data to a hash (fixed length of bytes32) by using **keccak256** off-chain & concatenate it with “0x”).\n * _To implement the process of converting KYC data to a hash (using the keccak256 algorithm) and then concatenate it with \"0x\" in a Flutter application, you will need to use a package that provides cryptographic hashing functionality._\n \n _One such package is_ `web3dart`_, which is commonly used for Ethereum-related operations in Flutter. This package includes utilities for generating keccak256 hashes._\n\n \n \n 2. User Address(Wallet address)\n \n * When the user clicks for the data NFT application on the app, the first wallet address will be created on the app and for this they will get authenticated through web3 using this documentation → <custom data-type=\"smartlink\" data-id=\"id-1\">https://rejuve-ai.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=~712020a783f9dbbdbe436da80643865bd2a562&title=RJV%20Smart%20Contract%20%20Integration%20with%20a%20sample%20flutter%20app.</custom> from here we will get wallet address. \n \n 3. Token URI ( Link to metadata in string format )\n \n * The next thing we want is a **Token-URI** for this we will use some JSON format of the user and convert the meta data to Token URI. For the metadata standard here is the open sea example(<custom data-type=\"smartlink\" data-id=\"id-2\">https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards</custom> )\n * Flow:\n \n For each user, You need to perform the following steps,\n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n Take the User info => create a JSON file in the backend => send this JSON file to IPFS(<custom data-type=\"smartlink\" data-id=\"id-3\">https://ipfs.tech/</custom> ) => IPFS will return a “hash”. Convert this hash to string format.\n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n Please note that, \n\n \n \n * For User A : you will have a different hash e.g. hashA\n * For User B : You will have a hashB\n \n \n \n\n \n \n These Hashes will be submitted as “token URI” input for each user to create an identity function\n\n \n \n 4. Nonce ( A unique number to prevent replay attacks - should be uniquely generated off-chain )\n \n * This is a unique number that will get called whenever the smart contract function is being called and this used to tackle a duplication attack\n * for this we will use a package that generates a unique number every time\n \n 5. identity contract address\n \n 1. a smart contract Address. \n \n \n * After having all these steps user will sign them and request for the Data NFT creation, \n \n * one example of the singing process is the way we sign in in <custom data-type=\"smartlink\" data-id=\"id-4\">https://opensea.io/</custom> using Metamask.\n \n \n3. Data NFT creation <custom data-type=\"smartlink\" data-id=\"id-5\">https://rejuve-ai.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RL/pages/5023415</custom> → This step will be implementednted in the rejuve Admin pannel not on the app\n\n * Here is a JSON format of the smart contract we have for the identity token creation. \n * we have the create identity smart contract function description in the JSON file. \n * ```json\n \n {\n \"inputs\": [\n {\n \"internalType\": \"bytes\",\n \"name\": \"signature\",\n \"type\": \"bytes\"\n },\n {\n \"internalType\": \"bytes32\",\n \"name\": \"kyc\",\n \"type\": \"bytes32\"\n },\n {\n \"internalType\": \"address\",\n \"name\": \"signer\",\n \"type\": \"address\"\n },\n {\n \"internalType\": \"string\",\n \"name\": \"tokenURI\",\n \"type\": \"string\"\n },\n {\n \"internalType\": \"uint256\",\n \"name\": \"nonce\",\n \"type\": \"uint256\"\n }\n ],\n \"name\": \"createIdentity\",\n \"outputs\": [],\n \"stateMutability\": \"nonpayable\",\n \"type\": \"function\"\n },\n ```\n * we have all the input here from step 2, so we can call this function from the Admin panel, \n * The issue here is how do we automate the creation of identity token contracts? needs further research\n \n4. In case of any successful Data NFT creation the wallet address of the user will get the created Data NFT\n\n"}``

1: User request to submit data\n\n* There is already a flow in the app(Old design) on how user will request to submit their data, so I will not go through that. \n* Only user who have NFT approved can request to submit a data\n* when user press submit data button in the app, they will sign a message and send a request\n* Sign Message → here is what the signing process looks like\n\n * It is off chain process(no smart contract function call)\n * message will contain the following information\n \n * signer address\n * nonce\n * Dhash(Data hash)\n \n * the sign process will be executed in the frontend\n \n* After user sign a message, there will be an API for submitting request of users for data submission or we can also use the current API for submit data\n\n### Step - 2: Calling the submit data on chain function\n\n* After user send data submission request, the request will get stored in a table with a name **submit_data**, and with the following information. \n\n * **id**\n * **Signature**\n * **Dhash**\n * **Signer address**\n \n* An admin will see the list of requests from an Admin panel\n\nWe need to implement an Admin Panel for this feature, for letting admin see submitted request and start running a batch smart contract execution process.\n\n* After Admin saw the request, there will be an option to select some of the request or all of them and run the smart contract on chain function\n\n * Here the Admin should have a **SPONSERD** role\n \n* The smart contract needs the following inputs\n\n * **Signer Address**\n * **Signature**\n * **Dhash(Data hash)**\n * **nonce**\n \n* The first 3 will be retrived from the **submit_data**, and for the last one we should implement some logic for generating new unique number every time the smart contract getting called. \n* Once the smart contract called and if the excution passed all the validation there, the data hash will be stored in one node chain, and in return we will get the following information\n\n * **data hash**\n * **token id**\n * **dataOwner**\n \n* here we will update the **submit_data**, with the above information\n* Since some other information is needed from the above list, when calling the **permission function** from the next step. the table will have the following information\n\n * **id**\n * **data hash**\n * **token id**\n * **data owner**\n * **username**\n * **submission_status**\n * **signature**\n \n\n### Step - 3 Any one can request for submitted data\n\n* In this process I will be explaining how people can request for accessing any of the submitted data\n* First, Obviously there should be some medium(way) for them to see any of the **submitted data,** and for this we need to implement a website(if we didn’t plan to post this to some of our existing or SNET website)\n* in the website from the information we got on Step-2, we will list the following information. \n\n * **name of the person** \n * **submission date**\n * Some additional information as per the need ….\n \n* And there will be an option for letting them to request permission to that particular data\n* We will be asking them to put their **product id(if there is any, other wise we will be creating a product id for them based on some other information they put there)**\n\n * here there will be some other detail we will ask for the requester as per the requirement\n \n* There will be a table with a name → **requested_data**, with the following information\n\n * **id**\n * **data_id(forign key → referenced from the submited_data table)**\n * **nextProductUID**\n * **expiration**\n \n\n### Step - 4: calling getPermission on chain function\n\n* All the other information needed for calling the getPermission on chain function will be retrieved from the **submited_data** table\n* Same as the other one here also we need to have an **Admin panel** for managing the list of permission requester\n* and from the panel we can run the **getPermission** on chain function for all of the permission requester or by selecting some of them. \n* The on chain function expect the following information\n\n * **signer**\n * **signature**\n * **memory**\n * **dHash**\n * **nextProductUID**\n * **nonce**\n * **expiration**\n \n* On a successful smart contract execution the following output get returned\n\n * **dataOwnerId,**\n * **requesterId**\n * **nextProductUID**\n * **dHash**\n * **permissionHash**\n \n* we will update the same database with the following information, and there should be a way to notify for the requester, through **email** probably\n* and then we will be providing data in csv or other format\n\nHere is some additional on chain function we might use. \n\n## External view functions:\n\n(They are view functions - Free to call as they don’t change blockchain state. We use them to view current state)\n\n1. **Get data by token ID**\n\n 1. Get data based on index\n \n2. **Get permission status**\n\n 1. Get permission status of a given data hash\n \n3. **Get data owner ID**\n\n 1. Get data owner identity token ID of given data hash\n \n4. **Get permission deadline**\n\n 1. Get expiration time in seconds\n \n5. **Get permission hashes**\n\n 1. Get permission hashes of given owner address\n \n\n \n \n\n<custom data-type=\"smartlink\" data-id=\"id-0\">https://rejuve-ai.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RL/pages/5023756</custom> \n\n‌"}`

User who is KYC passed can apply for identity token by signing a message using his private key off-chain. \n 2. **Note:** Messages that are signed off-chain by users should contain 5 inputs,\n \n 1. KYC Data (convert the KYC data to a hash (fix length of bytes32) by using keccak256 off-chain & concatenate it with “0x”) . Example:\n \n ```\n    const kycDataHash= “7924fbcf9a7f76ca5412304f2bf47e326b638e9e7c42ecad878ed9c22a8f1428\";\n    const kyc = “0x” + kycDataHash;\n ```\n 2. User address ( address who is signing the message )\n 3. Token URI ( Link to metadata in string format )\n 4. Nonce ( A unique number to prevent replay attacks - should be uniquely generated off-chain )\n 5. identity contract address \n \n \n 2. **KYC** \n \n 1. A link to KYC or any information that shows a user is KYC passed should be first converted off-chain to a bytes32 hash using keccak256 function and concatenate it with “0x“ . so the resulting input hash should be like \n \n ```\n “0x7924fbcf9a7f76ca5412304f2bf47e326b638e9e7c42ecad878ed9c22a8f1428“ \n ```\n \n \n\nValidity of KYC link / status should be checked off-chain before asking user to sign it & passing as input to the contract function.

`{"id":"5016154","status":"current","title":"Rejuve Rewards Store - Overview + Technical Specs","spaceId":"5013504","parentId":"5013978","parentType":"page","authorId":"607cf9077495ff006acd65e6","ownerId":"607cf9077495ff006acd65e6","lastOwnerId":null,"createdAt":"2022-06-02T00:26:33.518Z","body":"‌\n\n# Table of Contents\n\n---\n\n# **Overview**\n\nThe Rejuve.AI Rewards Area/Store is a menu item that will be accessible to all who download the app. This store will contain various products (and eventually services) to help boost health and longevity, included but not limited to: \n \n\\-Supplements \n\\-Wearables/health trackers \n\\-Home lab tests \n\\-Home DNA tests \n\\-Fitness equipment \n\\-Longevity spas/retreats \n \nIn the first edition of the App, we will be displaying **the item category, the partner/brand**, **the discount %**, and the **items included.** The user will complete the transaction on the partner’s website, entering the code they obtained from the app, and be returned to the Longevity app once their transaction is complete.\n\n## **Development Phases**\n\nThere are 2 phases of development of the _**Rejuve Rewards Store**_:\n\n1. **\\[Phase 1\\] - MVP Store with NO crypto layer.** \n Given the necessity to launch the App in the live app stores as soon as possible, there is not enough time to install the crypto layer/wallet intergradations + perform the necessary testing in time for launch. In this phase, the Rejuve Reward Store will list all partner products, either with universal discount codes/links (anyone can use), or single-use codes**\\*** (1 individual only), along with a flow to lead them to purchase the item from the partner’s website, re-directing them back to the App once the purchase is complete. \n This allows the Reward store to become active in the earliest version of the MVP as to not keep our partners waiting too long for sales to be generated, and as a proof of concept to gauge user interest and engagement (ex. which are the most popular products/categories). In this phase we will not need to collect any funds ourselves. Affiliate commissions for clicking these links/using these codes will be handled separately via agreement with the partners. \n \n **\\***Note that in order to keep things fair with single use codes, these will be limited to one per user ahead of Phase 2, in which we can increase it a little bit more\n2. **\\[Phase 2\\] - Store w/crypto layer/wallet integration** \n This is the ideal/final state where users can purchase various level discount codes (ex. 10%, 20% 50%, etc. depending on agreement with the partners), or even pay for items in full with their RJV tokens. Fulfillment is still done by the vendor; the main difference is that the single-use discount codes are not free and only available to RJV token holders. Users without tokens will still have access to multi-use/universal discount codes. This phase will require a period of testing on a Testnet to assure all flows are working correctly before releasing the Mainnet to the app users.\n\n* Note that spending in store is a separate item to claiming tokens for data, though they both require wallet connection.\n* At this time we do not have any whitelabelled or “native” product that are produced by Rejuve that we are selling directly, but this is expected to be added to the scope, at which time features such as in-app purchase will need to be activated in order to be compliant with Appstore regulations\n\n * We don’t expect to need to utilize in-app purchase for dicount vouchers or redirects to partner sites, since this is acting like more of a coupon system rather than directly purchasing from our App\n * We could also consider setting up a store that is not part of App architecture, such as woocommerce, that it links out to--mainly this is to avoid the appstores taking a large cut of the profits\n \n\n## **Products and Services**\n\nBelow are examples of products and services that could be offered in the Rejuve Rewards store. The categories can be further broken down into specifics (for example in Supplements we can divided into Skin & Beauty, Cardiovascular, Sleep, Mental Health, etc. or even by name like NMN). There can also be more categories added dependent upon suggestions/demand from the users and interest of industry/partners. \n\n‌\n\n| **Supplements** | **Lab Testing** | **Genetic Testing** | **Wearables/Health Trackers** \n \n | **Consultations/** \n**Advanced Therapies** | **Spas and Retreats** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Supplements that are mentioned by name in app/backed by scientific research in BayesExpert (i.e. the supplements that we would be recommending) Supplements that are being tested for a study or clinical trial Supplements requested by the community, from trusted sources | Tests that we ask for in the app Tests required for particular studies or clinical trials Tests to assess general wellbeing/longevity (ex. biological age, allergy/food sensitivity, etc.) | DNA Methylation Tests (assessing Hallmarks/epigenetics) Genome sequencing (more advanced than genotyping tests like 23&me, useful for our research with comparing fly DNA to human DNA, supercentenarian datasets) | Smart watches/fit bands Glucose monitors EEGs Metabolic trackers | Personal consultations with longevity doctors/clinics (in person or telemedicine) Advanced longevity therapies (ex. stem cells) Holistic/natural medicine consultations (ex. about which kinds of herbs or supplements you should be taking) | Spa packages Luxury health & wellness retreats Yoga/Meditation retreats |\n\n‌\n\n## Confirmed Partner Vendors\n\nBelow are vendors which we have spoken with and preliminarily agreed to list products in our app upon launch. We agreed to keep them in the loop on our development process/when we are ready to display product images and have the discount code redemption flow established. \n\n1. Garmin <custom data-type=\"smartlink\" data-id=\"id-0\">https://www.garmin.com/en-US/</custom> - Wearable health trackers\n2. Elevant <custom data-type=\"smartlink\" data-id=\"id-1\">https://elevant.co/</custom> - Longevity supplements\n3.

Travala <custom data-type=\"smartlink\" data-id=\"id-10\">https://www.travala.com/</custom> - Flight, accommodation, and experiences (there are no discount codes here, but worth highlighting somewhere that RJV can be used here) \n\n## **Hosting**\n\nWe have 2 options for how to host this store:\n\n1. **Utilizing native mobile In-App stores** such as iOS and Android platforms (utilizing, when required in-app purchase + any other payment methods including crypto) \n\n 1. Advantages / Pros: \n \\- Smoother UX experience in the mobile environment \n \\- Generally easier to setup / development wise using the native mobile APIs \n \\- Easier for users to download/use crypto wallets that exist legitimately in the iOS/Android app stores\n 2. Disadvantages / Cons: \n \\- Google & Apple are taking 15-30% cuts on all non RJV token payments (possibly charging on overall revenue.. unsure if Token transactions constitute revenue as the standards are not clear)\n \n 1. <custom data-type=\"smartlink\" data-id=\"id-11\">https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/</custom> \n 2. <custom data-type=\"smartlink\" data-id=\"id-12\">https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10632485?hl=en#zippy=%2Chow-does-my-account-group-enroll-in-the-service-fee-tier</custom> \n \n 3. In-App Purchase guidelines/info\n \n 1. <custom data-type=\"smartlink\" data-id=\"id-13\">https://play.google.com/console/about/in-appproductssetup/</custom> \n 2. <custom data-type=\"smartlink\" data-id=\"id-14\">https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/</custom> \n \n \n2. **Webstore** (shop located on another platform such as Shopify or WooCommerce, visible as a webview in the app) \n\n 1. Advantages / Pros \n \\- Less technical development needed (tools ready-made) \n \\- Retain more profits from sales (we would still need to pay typical subscriptions, service fees, transaction fees etc. but would likely not be to the degree of Apple and Google)\n 2. Disadvantages / Cons: \n \\- Less customization options (have to work with their templates) \n \\- Rougher user experience in the way that users would need to create an additional account with these vendors \n \\- Takes users out of the App \n \n\n**\\*\\*At this time we are utilizing Option 1 without any need for direct purchases, leaving Option 2 as a posibility when we get to the point of selling our own products.**\n\n## **Pricing Model**\n\nGiven that early editions of the App are mostly discount code based, the pricing on the redemption of these vouchers/coupons can be done in a few different ways: \n \n**1**- **1:1** The cost of the voucher is equal to the value of the discount code, in RJV tokens. Somehow this seems to be a bit pointless/begs question of if it is much cheaper at all to redeem the tokens for this code vs trading them on the open market for fiat to make up the difference instead.\n\n**2**- **Fixed token-based pricing based on formulas** This approach leads to a better customer experience, however is more complicated to figure out because it is dependent on factors such as how much the product is at full price (ex. $400 test vs $40 supplement), % of discount, and the current price of RJV. This would look something like: \nItems <$50 - 100 RJV for 10%, 200 RJV for 20%\n\nItems $50-$400 - 200 RJV for 10%, 500 RJV for 20%\n\nItems >$400 - 500 RJV for 10%, 1000 RJV for 20%\n\netc.\n\n**3**- **Package/subscription model** User pays a certain amount of RJV per some time interval, or one-time, to be able to access all of a certain tier of discount codes. This is an overall simpler than approach #2, but it still subject to factors like the price of RJV and the number of single-use code products/partners available in the store (ex. if there is only 4 products with single use codes, is it really worth it?) Also, what if someone only wants 1 particular product, is it worth their while? Still calls for there being an individualistic option to subscribe to one partner/item only…\n\nEx: \n5000 RJV/yr = unlimited access to all 10% offers \n10000 RJVyr = unlimited access to all 10 & 20% offers \n15000 RJV/yr = unlimited access to all offers \n\nor\n\n3000 RJV/yr = unlimited offers on Marine Healthfoods supplements \n\n---\n\nAs we begin to have more partners accepting RJV as a form of payment, it could eventually obsolete the above model completely. In this case, pricing no longer matters as it would still be overall set by the partner\n\n (ex. regular price of Garmin watch is $250, RJV holders get 20% off, so they pay $200 worth of RJV)\n\nIn the event that we sell our own products, Rejuve would similarly offer discounts to those paying in RJV, and higher prices for those who choose a fiat method like Apple Pay. \n\n## **Revenue Model**\n\nThe simplest model for Startups to earn revenue on product referrals is an Affiliate model. The partner provides us with affiliate links to track that the customer purchased the items via our app/platform, and return to us a pre-agreed share of the sale profits. \n \nExample: \n**Apollo Neuro band** \nAffiliate link 1 (no discounts): Rejuve earns X% commission \nAffiliate link 2 (with discounts): Rejuve does not earn commission, as it is included in the discounted price \n \nSome vendors offer affiliate commissions on discounted purchases as well, which is the ideal scenario. \nDiscount codes themselves may also be tracking purchases/attached to commissions. \n\n\\*It is worth noting that the Rewards Store is not anticipated to generate as much revenue as Premium Subscriptions for example, but is more about stimulating and sustaining the Token Economy, ensuring that we have good inflow and outflow of RJV to help replenish the Data Contributor rewards reserve, as well as boost overall liquidity and supply/demand of the token. \n\n---\n\n# Product Requirements\n\n## Phase I\n\n### User Story\n\n* As a: Rejuve Longevity app user \n* I want to: purchase trusted products to improve my health and longevity and services at a discounted rate\n* So that: I can save money and see a real-time benefit of using and continuing to use this app as opposed to other apps out there\n\n#### **Journey:** \n\nUser takes some surveys, gets a biological age, and finds the insights and recommendations to be helpful and informative. They regularly take supplements from their local health food stores, but are interested in trying new supplements that are scientifically backed and specific to longevity. This user may not be familiar with cryptocurrency, but is interested in earning rewards for health data. They notice that the Rewards Store is currently offering limited time free product discounts. \n \nThe supplement [Glylo](https://juvifyhealth.com/products/glylo-healthy-aging-weight-management-pill?selling_plan=561840176), a longevity/weight loss supplement catches their eye as it is affordable and backed by a leading aging research institution. The user confirms that they would like to use one of their free discount allowances on this particular vendor, and receives the code + link to the Cart/Complete Purchase area of the partner website to complete their purchase. \n\n#### \n**Requirements:**\n\n* User completes a certain amount of actions in app (ex. complete 1 surveys) before redeeming discount codes\n* User has a limit of one single use code redemption per account (no limits on universal codes as this is not possible, though should still have minimum App actions to reveal)\n\n * Be sure to include any terms such as applicable items, expiration dates, and combinations with other offers (this is likely mentioned on vendor site but good to also include on ours when known)\n \n* Categorized by type (ex. Supplement, Wearable, etc.), partners, and discount %\n\n * Eligible items listed within the Partner’s page\n \n* The coupon codes themselves are generated by the vendor, we are simply “revealing” them according to our specifications\n\n * For example, [TruDiagnostic ](https://trudiagnostic.com/collections/shop)has already provided us with 2 discount codes **‘RejuveLife10’** for 10% off and **‘RejuveReward20’** for 20% off\n \n\n## Phase II\n\n### User Story\n\n* As a: Rejuve Longevity app user \n* I want to: purchase trusted products to improve my health and longevity using my earned RJV tokens\n* So that: I can gain real-world usage of my earned tokens/truly make my data work for me\n\n#### **Journey:** \n\nUser completes their health profiles and surveys, sign up for a data NFT. They connect their wallet and claim the NFT and their accumulated tokens, submitting their data to our Data Commons. They now want to know what they can immediately do with these tokens in our App. They have never taken any biological age tests, and are familiar with some supplements. They have seen GlycanAge featured on several longevity websites and conferences, and are interested to try it out. \n\nUser clicks on Store and navigates to GlycanAge tests. They read the offer and decide they would like to proceed with purchasing the item in full with RJV at the special network members' discounted rate. The App takes them to the partner site to order the test and fill in their address details. They are then re-directed back to the Longevity App to connect their wallet (if not connected already) and complete the purchase, brining them to the Purchased screen. \n\n#### \n**Requirements:**\n\n* Updated Store design clearly delineating which products are “free for all”, which are discount voucher only, and which are available for full payment in RJV\n* Ability to connect various wallets, including Cardano (most will prefer BsC or Cardano due to the high transaction fees on Ethereum)\n* Data NFT integrated (only necessary for claiming tokens from App, not necessary for those who already have RJV in their wallets)\n* Partners accepting RJV via [Nowpayments](https://nowpayments.io/) gateway OR Rejuve offering discount vouchers or products via this gateway or via direct wallet transfer to a designated address\n* Smooth UX/UI to redirect user to the partner’s page to enter in their details (we don’t want these, and are not fulfilling orders), and be redirected to our App to complete the purchase, even though the wallet address they are interacting with will belong to the Partner on the backend \n\n"}`

Perfect! Now I have comprehensive information from both Jira and Confluence. Let me create a detailed analysis that connects the Jira issues with the Confluence documentation.

## My Understanding

I searched Confluence using advanced CQL queries to find all documentation related to blockchain, Web3, wallets, NFTs, RJV tokens, and cryptocurrency. I found 76+ relevant documents and retrieved the full content of the most critical ones that directly relate to the Jira issues we identified earlier. This approach ensures comprehensive coverage by mapping technical implementation details from Confluence to active development work tracked in Jira.
