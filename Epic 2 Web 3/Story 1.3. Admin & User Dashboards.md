## Technical Specifications

### Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard will provide Rejuve administrators with tools to:

1. **User Verification Management**:
   - View verification status of all users
   - Track verification completion rates
   - Identify verification issues or failures
   - Assist with manual verification when needed

2. **Data NFT Monitoring**:
   - Track total NFTs minted
   - View NFT status by user
   - Monitor permission changes
   - Export NFT analytics

3. **Data Permission Analytics**:
   - Visualize permission grant trends
   - Track permission revocations
   - Analyze data usage by permission type
   - Generate compliance reports

4. **System Health Monitoring**:
   - Track blockchain transaction success rates
   - Monitor gas costs and usage
   - Identify integration issues with Civic or ZKpass
   - View system error logs

### User Dashboard

The user-facing dashboard will provide app users with:

1. **Data NFT Status**:
   - View NFT details and properties
   - Display verification status
   - Show ownership proof
   - Explain NFT benefits and utility

2. **Permission Management**:
   - Toggle data sharing permissions by category
   - Set permission durations/expirations
   - View permission change history
   - Batch update permissions

3. **Data Usage Tracking**:
   - View when and how data has been accessed
   - Track rewards earned from data sharing
   - Review which research projects used their data
   - Consent to new data usage requests

4. **Educational Resources**:
   - Access guides on data ownership
   - Learn about blockchain and NFT technology
   - Understand data privacy implications
   - Get help with dashboard features

## Technical Implementation

   - Verification completion analytics
   - Reward calculation based on data usage

4. **Integration Layer**:
   - Blockchain data indexing
   - Smart contract event monitoring
   - Civic/ZKpass status synchronization
   - Data storage system integration

## Security & Privacy Considerations

- Role-based access control for admin dashboard
- End-to-end encryption for all dashboard communications
- Audit logging of all permission changes
- Privacy-preserving analytics (aggregate data only)
- Compliance with GDPR "right to access" requirements
- Two-factor authentication for admin access

## User Experience Design

### Admin Dashboard UX

- Clean, intuitive interface with clear navigation
- Dashboard homepage with key metrics and alerts
- User search with advanced filtering
- Detailed user profiles with verification history
- Interactive charts and data visualizations
- Bulk actions for efficient management
