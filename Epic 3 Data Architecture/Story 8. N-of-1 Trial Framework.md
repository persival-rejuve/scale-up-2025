# Story 8: N-of-1 Trial Framework

## Overview
This story focuses on developing a comprehensive framework for conducting personalized n-of-1 trials within the Rejuve Network platform. This system will enable users to systematically test the effects of specific interventions on their health, collect structured data before, during, and after interventions, and contribute to aggregated research insights about what works for whom and why.
