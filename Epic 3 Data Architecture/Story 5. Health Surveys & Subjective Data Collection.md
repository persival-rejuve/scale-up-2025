# Story 5: Health Surveys & Subjective Data Collection

## Overview
This story focuses on developing the infrastructure for collecting subjective health data through surveys and self-reported metrics. It will enable both structured long-form health assessments and quick daily check-ins to capture the user's perceived wellness, complementing objective data from wearables and providing context for health patterns.

## Business Value
- Captures essential subjective health data not measurable by devices
- Provides context for objective measurements from wearables
- Enables correlation between perceived wellness and biometric data
- Supports personalized health insights through comprehensive data collection
- Creates a foundation for user-reported outcomes in n-of-1 trials

## Current Status
- Planning phase
- Researching validated health assessment instruments
- Evaluating user experience approaches for survey completion

## Technical Requirements

### Survey Framework Architecture

#### Survey Data Model
- Survey definition schema
  - Question types (multiple choice, scale, free text, etc.)
  - Conditional logic and branching
  - Skip patterns and dependencies
  - Scoring algorithms
  - Result interpretation rules

- Response data structure
  - Answer storage with timestamps
  - Completion status tracking
  - Response quality indicators
  - Time-to-complete metrics
  - Context information (device, location, etc.)

- Survey metadata
  - Version control and history
  - Authorship and source
  - Validation status
  - Target population
  - Estimated completion time

#### Survey Categories

1. **Long-form Health Assessments** (Every 3-4 months)
   - Comprehensive health status evaluations
   - Detailed exercise and physical activity patterns
   - Nutritional habits and dietary patterns
   - Sleep quality and habits assessment
   - Stress and mental wellbeing evaluation
   - Cognitive function self-assessment

2. **Short-form Daily/Weekly Check-ins**
   - Perceived energy levels
   - Mood and emotional state
   - Sleep quality perception
   - Physical discomfort or symptoms
   - Stress levels and mental clarity
   - Daily habits adherence

3. **Intervention-specific Questionnaires**
   - Pre/post intervention self-assessments
   - Side effect monitoring
   - Perceived efficacy tracking
   - Adherence and compliance reporting
   - Experiential feedback

4. **Symptom and Event Tracking**
   - Illness and symptom logging
   - Menstrual cycle tracking
   - Flare-up reporting for chronic conditions
   - Recovery monitoring
   - Adverse event reporting

### Survey Management System

- Recommendation triggering rules

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Survey Framework Foundation
1. Design survey data model and schema
2. Create survey definition system
3. Build response storage architecture
4. Implement survey versioning system
5. Develop core question type components

### Phase 2: Long-form Assessments
1. Implement validated health assessment instruments
2. Create scoring and interpretation engines
3. Build baseline health profiling surveys
4. Develop progress comparison tools
5. Create visualization for long-term changes

### Phase 3: Daily Check-ins
1. Design minimal-friction check-in experiences
2. Implement adaptive questioning logic
3. Build notification and reminder system
4. Create streaks and completion incentives
5. Develop quick-insights from daily responses

### Phase 4: Integration & Analysis
1. Implement correlation engine with wearable data
2. Create contextual enhancement for metrics
3. Build survey-triggered follow-up system
4. Develop comprehensive health timeline views
5. Implement personalized insight generators

## Technical Challenges

- **Survey Fatigue**: Balancing data collection needs with user burden
- **Response Quality**: Ensuring thoughtful, accurate responses
- **Standardization**: Normalizing responses across different instruments
- **Interpretation**: Creating meaningful insights from subjective data
- **Context Preservation**: Maintaining situational context for responses
- **Adaptability**: Evolving surveys based on individual health profiles

## Security & Privacy Considerations

- Sensitive nature of mental health and subjective wellbeing data
- Appropriate anonymization for research use
- Clear consent for specific survey purposes
- Secure storage of historical responses
- Ethical considerations for triggering surveys based on detected patterns

## Dependencies

- Core data schema from Story 2
- User profile system for personalization
- Notification system for survey reminders
- Mobile and web front-end components

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System successfully stores and administers both long and short-form surveys
2. Users can complete surveys across multiple platforms with saved progress
3. Scheduling system delivers surveys at appropriate intervals
4. Response data is properly normalized and scored
5. Survey results are correlated with objective metrics
6. Trend analysis shows changes in subjective health measures over time
7. Survey builder tools enable creation of new assessment instruments
8. System adapts question delivery based on user context and history
