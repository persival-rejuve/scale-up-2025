  - Format-agnostic to handle diverse data sources
  - Partitioned for efficient data management

- **Processed Data Zone**: Cleaned, validated data ready for analysis
  - Standardized schemas and formats
  - Indexed for efficient querying
  - Data quality metrics applied and tracked

- **Analytics Data Zone**: Optimized for fast analysis and reporting
  - Pre-aggregated views for common queries
  - Time-series optimized structures
  - Feature stores for ML and AI applications

#### Processing Framework
- Real-time data processing pipeline for wearables and continuous monitoring
- Batch processing capabilities for lab results and periodic assessments
- Stream processing for user interactions and real-time recommendations

#### Scalability Requirements
- Horizontal scaling for handling user growth
- Vertical scaling for complex analytical workloads
- Auto-scaling based on usage patterns and demand
- Resource optimization for cost efficiency

### Data Governance

#### Security Framework
- End-to-end encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for data access
- Audit logging of all data access and modifications
- Secure API gateway for external integrations

#### Compliance Components
- GDPR compliance tooling and processes
- HIPAA-aligned security controls where applicable
- Data residency controls for regional compliance
- Consent management system for user data permissions

#### Data Quality
- Data validation at ingestion points
- Quality metrics and monitoring
- Automated anomaly detection
- Data lineage tracking

### Operational Components

#### Monitoring & Alerting
- System health monitoring
- Data pipeline monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
- Anomaly detection and alerting

#### Disaster Recovery
- Regular backup procedures
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities
- Failover mechanisms
- Recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) definitions

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Architecture Design & Validation
1. Finalize technical stack selection
2. Create detailed architecture diagrams
3. Develop data flow models
4. Define security and governance frameworks
5. Create proof-of-concept for critical components

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure Deployment
1. Set up cloud infrastructure using IaC
2. Deploy core data storage components
3. Implement security controls and monitoring
4. Establish CI/CD pipelines
5. Create development and testing environments

### Phase 3: Data Pipeline Implementation
1. Build data ingestion services
2. Implement data processing pipelines
3. Create data validation mechanisms
4. Set up data quality monitoring
5. Develop initial API endpoints

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization
1. Perform load and performance testing
2. Conduct security assessments
3. Optimize resource utilization
4. Complete documentation
5. Prepare for handover to operations

## Security & Privacy Considerations

- Personal health data classification and handling procedures
- Privacy-by-design principles implementation
- Data minimization and purpose limitation controls
- User consent and permission management
- Data retention and deletion policies

## Dependencies

- Cloud provider selection decisions
- Regulatory requirements finalization
- Integration with Web3 identity system from Epic 2
- Budget approval for infrastructure costs

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Architecture documentation is complete and approved
2. Infrastructure is deployed and operational in all environments
3. Data pipelines successfully process test data with expected outcomes
4. Security controls pass third-party assessment
5. System can scale to handle projected user load (benchmark: 100,000 users)
6. Monitoring and alerting systems are operational
7. Data governance controls are implemented and tested
8. Recovery procedures are documented and tested
