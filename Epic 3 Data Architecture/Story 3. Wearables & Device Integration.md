## Technical Challenges

- **API Limitations**: Many wearable platforms have strict rate limits and data access restrictions
- **Data Inconsistency**: Different devices measure the same metrics with varying accuracy and methodologies
- **Sync Frequency**: Balancing timely data with system load and battery impact on mobile devices
- **Schema Evolution**: Managing changes to device data formats and capabilities over time
- **Historical Data**: Supporting bulk import of historical data while maintaining performance
- **User Privacy**: Ensuring appropriate permissions for sensitive health metrics

## Security & Privacy Considerations

- Granular permission model for different data types
- Secure storage of device API tokens
- Transparency about which devices are connected and sharing data
- User ability to disconnect devices and delete associated data
- Clear data retention policies for device-sourced data

## Dependencies

- Core data schema from Story 2
- Data processing infrastructure from Story 1
- Mobile app authentication system
- User profile and preferences management

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can connect all Priority 1 devices to their Rejuve profile
2. Daily synchronization occurs reliably for connected devices
3. Data is properly normalized across different device types
4. System handles connection errors and sync failures gracefully
5. Users can view which devices are connected and manage connections
6. Historical data import works for supported devices
7. Data from multiple devices measuring the same metrics is properly reconciled
8. System scales to handle high volume of incoming device data
