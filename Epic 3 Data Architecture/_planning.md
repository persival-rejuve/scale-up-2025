# Epic 3: Data Architecture - Planning Document

## Epic Overview

**Epic 3: Data Architecture** will establish a centralized data storage system for data science and AI within the Rejuve Network platform. This system will enable global health enthusiasts to track personal health data and wellness/longevity protocols while receiving science-backed AI-driven insights and recommendations. A key feature will be supporting decentralized n-of-1 trials, allowing users to measure the effects of specific interventions and contribute to aggregated research data.

## Strategic Objectives

1. Create a scalable, secure, and GDPR-compliant data architecture
2. Enable comprehensive health data collection from multiple sources
3. Support time-series analysis of user health metrics
4. Facilitate AI-driven insights and personalized recommendations
5. Enable decentralized n-of-1 trials for longevity interventions
6. Ensure user data privacy and security while enabling research capabilities

## Proposed Stories

### Story 1: Data Architecture & Infrastructure Setup
- Design and implement the core data architecture
- Establish cloud infrastructure for data storage and processing
- Create data governance frameworks and security protocols
- Set up development, staging, and production environments
- Implement monitoring and logging systems

### Story 2: Core Data Schema & User Health Profile
- Define comprehensive health data schemas
- Implement user profile data model (demographics, chronic conditions, medications)
- Design relational and document-based storage systems as needed
- Establish baseline health metrics and reference ranges
- Enable longitudinal tracking of user health profiles

### Story 3: Wearables & Device Integration
- Implement API connections to popular wearable devices
- Design data normalization for multi-device compatibility

### Story 6: Lab Tests & Medical Records Integration
- Create secure storage for lab test results and medical documents
- Implement PDF parsing and data extraction capabilities
- Design schema for standardized lab test results
- Support integration with biological age testing services
- Implement delta tracking for lab metrics over time

### Story 7: Time-Series Analysis & Data Visualization
- Develop data warehouse for time-based health analytics
- Implement time-series databases optimized for health data
- Create correlation engines between different data types
- Design trend analysis algorithms for personal health metrics
- Enable data visualization for user insights and patterns

### Story 8: N-of-1 Trial Framework
- Design protocol framework for personal experimentation
- Create statistical models for measuring intervention effects
- Implement anonymous data aggregation for population research
- Support defining control periods and intervention periods
- Enable AI-driven hypothesis generation for health improvements

## Dependencies & Considerations

- Integration with Web3 identity verification (from Epic 2)
- Privacy and security requirements for handling medical data
- GDPR and other regional data protection regulations
- Scalability needs for processing large volumes of health data
- AI/ML integration requirements for data insights
- Real-time vs. batch processing requirements for different data types

## Technical Stack Considerations

- Cloud provider selection (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
- Database technologies (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Timestream/InfluxDB)
- Data processing frameworks (Apache Spark, Airflow)
- API gateway and service mesh architecture
- Data encryption and security frameworks
- Compliance and audit capabilities

## Next Steps

1. Develop detailed requirements for each story
2. Create sequence diagrams for key data workflows
3. Establish data privacy and governance frameworks
4. Select technical stack and architecture patterns
5. Begin development of core data architecture components
