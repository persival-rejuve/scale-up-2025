# Story 2: Core Data Schema & User Health Profile

## Overview
This story focuses on designing and implementing the foundational data schemas that will power the Rejuve Network platform's health data ecosystem. It will establish the core user health profile model, capturing essential health information while creating a flexible system that can evolve as health science advances.

## Business Value
- Enables comprehensive user health profiling for personalized insights
- Creates a foundation for correlating diverse health metrics
- Supports longitudinal tracking of health changes over time
- Allows appropriate categorization of users for research cohorts
- Facilitates precise, personalized health recommendations

## Current Status
- Planning phase
- Initial schema design drafts in development
- Evaluating industry standard health data models

## Technical Requirements

### User Health Profile Schema

#### Core User Attributes
- Basic Demographics
  - Age, biological sex, gender identity
  - Geographic location (region/country)
  - Ethnicity (relevant for genetic factors)
  - Height, weight, body composition

- Health History
  - Chronic conditions and diagnoses
  - Medication history and current medications
  - Surgical and medical procedures
  - Family health history
  - Vaccination records

- Lifestyle Baseline
  - General activity level
  - Dietary patterns and preferences
  - Sleep patterns and habits
  - Stress management approaches
  - Current supplements and practices

#### Health Status Tracking
- Baseline health metrics and reference ranges
- User-specific normal ranges
- Health goals and targets
- Change history of key metrics
- Health age calculations

### Schema Design Specifications

#### Data Modeling Approach
- Hybrid relational/document model for flexibility and performance
- Strong typing for critical health metrics
- Extensible property system for emerging health factors
- Versioned schema design to track changes over time
- Support for both structured and unstructured health data

#### Key Entity Relationships
- User Profile → Health Metrics (one-to-many)
- User Profile → Health Conditions (one-to-many)
- User Profile → Medications (one-to-many)
- User Profile → Consent Settings (one-to-one)
- Health Metrics → Reference Ranges (many-to-many)

#### Temporal Considerations
- Effective dating for all health records
- Point-in-time reconstruction of health profile
- Tracking of metric change velocity and trends
- Support for irregular measurement cadences
- Lifecycle stage markers for age-appropriate references

### Data Quality & Validation

#### Validation Rules
- Range validation for physiological measurements
- Consistency checks across related health metrics
- Medical terminology standardization
- Unit conversion and normalization
- Data completeness requirements

#### Reference Data Management
- Medical terminology dictionaries
- Condition and medication taxonomies
- Normal ranges by demographic
- Unit conversion factors
- Health metric interdependencies

### API Layer

#### Core Profile APIs
- Create/update profile endpoints
- Health history management
- Medication tracking
- Health goals management
- Profile completeness scoring

#### Integration Endpoints
- EMR/EHR integration interfaces
- Wearable profile synchronization
- Third-party health service connectors
- Research data anonymization
- Aggregate metrics calculation

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Schema Design
1. Finalize core user health profile model
2. Define validation and quality rules
3. Create reference data frameworks
4. Design schema versioning approach
5. Document data dictionary and relationships

### Phase 2: Database Implementation
1. Configure database systems for structured data
2. Implement document stores for flexible health data
3. Set up reference data repositories
4. Create indexing strategy for performance
5. Implement sharding/partitioning for scale

### Phase 3: API Development
1. Develop core profile management APIs
2. Implement validation services
3. Create health metric tracking endpoints
4. Build health history management features
5. Develop profile completeness calculation

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
1. Validate with synthetic health profiles
2. Test boundary conditions and edge cases
3. Perform data migration simulations
4. Conduct performance and scale testing
5. Verify compliance with health data standards

## Security & Privacy Considerations

- Data classification for sensitive health information
- Field-level encryption for highly sensitive data
- Access control based on data sensitivity
- Anonymization capabilities for research use
- Consent tracking for specific data elements

## Dependencies

- Data architecture fundamentals from Story 1
- Health data standards selection
- Medical terminology reference data sources
- Privacy requirements finalization

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Core data schema documentation is complete and approved
2. Database implementation successfully stores and retrieves user health profiles
3. APIs correctly manage health profile creation and updates
4. Validation rules effectively ensure data quality
5. System can support all required health data types
6. Schema evolution process is documented and tested
7. Reference data management system is operational
8. Performance meets requirements for user profile operations

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Schema inflexibility | High | Medium | Design for extensibility; implement schema versioning |
| Data quality issues | High | High | Implement strong validation; data quality monitoring |
| Performance at scale | Medium | Medium | Indexing strategy; performance testing at scale |
| Medical data complexity | Medium | High | Consult with health data experts; use established standards |
| Schema evolution challenges | Medium | Medium | Carefully design migration paths; backward compatibility |
