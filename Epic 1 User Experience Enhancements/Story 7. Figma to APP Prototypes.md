#### Story Title

**Implement Rapid Figma to Flutter Prototype Pipeline Using AI Tools**

*Version: 0.1 | Date: 2025-06-07 | Created by: Persival Ballesté*

#### Story Overview

As a **UX designer and developer team** at Longevity App,  
I **want to convert Figma designs into functional Flutter prototypes using AI tools**,  
so that we can rapidly test user interfaces with real users and iterate on designs without lengthy manual coding cycles.

#### Functional Scope

|Phase|Capability|Summary|
|---|---|---|
|**1. Tool Selection & Integration**|• Evaluate and select optimal **AI-powered Figma-to-Flutter** tools. • Establish integration workflow between design and development teams. • Configure selected tools with existing design system components.|Creates foundation for automated prototype generation|
|**2. Prototype Generation Pipeline**|• Implement automated conversion of Figma designs to Flutter code. • Develop quality assurance checks for generated code. • Create version control system for prototypes.|Enables rapid generation of testable Flutter prototypes|
|**3. Feedback & Iteration System**|• Implement user feedback collection within prototypes. • Create metrics dashboard for prototype performance. • Establish workflow for incorporating feedback into design iterations.|Closes the loop between design, testing, and refinement|

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Tool Effectiveness**
    - Selected tool(s) accurately convert Figma designs to Flutter code with ≥85% component fidelity.
    - Conversion process requires minimal manual intervention.
    - All core UI components and interactions are properly translated.
        
2. **Prototype Functionality**
    - Generated prototypes function on both iOS and Android devices.
    - Prototypes maintain design system consistency (colors, typography, spacing).
    - Basic navigation and interactions work as specified in Figma.
        
3. **Development Speed**
    - Design-to-prototype cycle time is reduced by at least 70% compared to manual coding.
    - Iteration based on feedback can be implemented within 1 business day.
    - Designers can generate testable prototypes without developer assistance.
        
4. **Integration**
    - Generated code follows Flutter best practices and can be integrated into production code if needed.
    - Assets and resources are properly managed and optimized.
    - Prototypes connect to mock data sources for realistic testing.
        
5. **Feedback Collection**
    - Prototypes include embedded feedback mechanisms for testers.
    - Usage analytics are captured for evaluating UI effectiveness.
    - Feedback is automatically aggregated into actionable reports.

#### Implementation Tasks (high-level)

- **UX & Design**
    
    - Audit and standardize Figma component library for optimal conversion.
        
    - Establish naming conventions and structure compatible with selected tools.
        
    - Create documentation for design-to-prototype workflow.
        
- **Development**
    
    - Set up integration between Figma and selected Flutter code generation tools.
        
    - Create scripts or automation for batch prototype generation.
        
    - Implement quality checks for generated code.
        
- **Testing & Feedback**
    
    - Develop feedback collection mechanisms for prototypes.
        
    - Create testing protocol for evaluating prototype fidelity.
        
    - Build analytics dashboard for prototype usage data.
        
- **Infrastructure**
    
    - Set up CI/CD pipeline for prototype deployment.
        
    - Configure version control for both designs and generated code.
        
    - Establish secure sharing mechanism for stakeholders and testers.
        
- **Training**
    
    - Develop training materials for designers on prototype-friendly Figma practices.
        
    - Train developers on extending and modifying generated code.
        
    - Create documentation for the entire prototype workflow.

#### Dependencies & Risks

|Item|Impact|Mitigation|
|---|---|---|
|AI tool limitations|High|Establish guidelines for designs that convert well; prepare fallback manual coding for complex components|
|Design system inconsistency|Medium|Audit and refactor Figma components before implementation; enforce naming conventions|
|Learning curve|Medium|Provide comprehensive training and documentation; start with simpler UI sections|
|Cost scaling|Medium|Evaluate pricing models and usage patterns; optimize tool utilization|

#### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Generated prototypes must maintain 60fps animations and transitions on target devices.
    
- **Compatibility**: Prototypes must function on iOS 14+ and Android 9+.
    
- **Scalability**: System should handle conversion of designs for all app sections without degradation.
    
- **Security**: Prototype sharing and feedback must comply with company data security policies.
    
- **Maintainability**: Generated code should be readable and maintainable by the development team.

---

#### Definition of Done

- Selected tools successfully integrated into the design-development workflow.
    
- Designers can independently generate functional Flutter prototypes from Figma designs.
    
- Prototype generation time meets target reduction compared to manual development.
    
- Feedback collection system is operational and data flows to analytics dashboard.
    
- Training materials and documentation are complete and approved by team leads.
    
- System has been used successfully for at least 3 feature iterations with measured time savings.
