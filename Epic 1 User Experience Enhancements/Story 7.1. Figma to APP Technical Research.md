## üöÄ **Scenario 2: Full Development Lifecycle Tools**
*From design to deployment*

### **1. FlutterFlow** ‚≠ê *Top Choice for Complete Platform*
- **Type**: [No-Code Platform](https://www.flutterflow.io/pricing)
- **Pricing**: 
  - Free: $0/month (build & test)
  - Standard: $30/month ($22 annually) - source code download
  - Pro: $70/month ($59 annually) - source code download + custom domains
- **Key Features**:
  - Complete visual development environment
  - Real device preview
  - Figma integration for importing designs
  - Backend integration (Firebase, Supabase)
  - Custom code insertion
  - State management
  - Authentication flows
  - CodePath Academy training resources
- **Best For**: Complete app development from design to deployment
- **Limitations**: Custom code integration can be challenging for complex apps

### **2. Builder.io Visual Copilot** ‚≠ê *Top Choice for Enterprise Teams*
- **Type**: [Enterprise AI Platform](https://www.builder.io/m/visual-copilot)
- **Pricing**: Enterprise (contact for pricing)
- **Key Features**:
  - Enterprise-grade AI code generation
  - Business context understanding
  - Multi-framework support (including Flutter)
  - Integration with existing codebases
  - Design system awareness
- **Best For**: Large teams with existing design systems
- **Limitations**: Enterprise pricing model

## üí° **Scenario 3: Developer Productivity Tools**
*For enhancing the manual coding process*

### **1. Cursor Code Editor** ‚≠ê *Top Choice for Coding Assistance*
- **Type**: [AI-Enhanced IDE](https://cursor.sh/)
- **Pricing**: Free, Pro: $20/month
- **Key Features**:
  - Advanced code generation
  - Visual styling assistance
  - Figma-inspired design tools integration
  - Chat interface for coding assistance
  - Local development
- **Best For**: Developers who want AI assistance while maintaining full control
- **Limitations**: Not a complete Figma-to-app solution

## Technical Implementation Recommendations

Based on our evaluation, we recommend implementing a hybrid approach:

1. Use FlutterFlow for rapid prototyping and initial app development
2. Integrate with Cursor for more complex coding needs
3. Establish a CI/CD pipeline for testing and deployment
4. Implement a feedback loop from prototypes to design improvements

This approach gives us the best balance between speed and control over the final product."
