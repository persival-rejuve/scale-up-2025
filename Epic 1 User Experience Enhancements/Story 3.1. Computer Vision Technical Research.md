# Research on Computer Vision APIs for Meal and Ingredient Identification

## Executive Summary

Check the full report at [[Story 3.1.1 Complete research report]]

This report presents an in-depth research on services and APIs with AI computer vision capabilities for identifying meals and their ingredients from mobile phone pictures. The main objective is to provide a detailed analysis of the available options in the market, focusing on the granularity of ingredient identification for health science purposes.

Our primary recommendation is a hybrid approach combining LogMeal Food AI for food recognition with Spoonacular Food API for detailed nutritional information. This combination offers the best balance between accuracy in ingredient identification and cost-effectiveness, with an estimated implementation time of 10-17 days and initial operational costs of approximately $259-$339 per month.

## Introduction

Accurate identification of foods and their ingredients from images represents a significant challenge at the intersection of computer vision, artificial intelligence, and health science. Applications in this area have the potential to revolutionize nutritional monitoring, assist in diet management, identify allergens, and support public health research.

This report investigates the main solutions available in the market that allow the identification of meals and the granular analysis of their ingredients from photographs taken by mobile devices. The focus is on APIs and services that can be integrated into mobile applications developed with Flutter and Python backends.

The main objectives of this research are:

1. Identify and analyze the most suitable APIs for food and ingredient recognition
2. Compare features, limitations, costs, and ease of integration
3. Provide practical code examples for implementation
4. Recommend the best solution considering accuracy, cost, and implementation time

## Technical Implementation Plan

Our analysis points to a hybrid approach using LogMeal for image recognition and Spoonacular for nutritional details as the most effective solution. Implementation will require:

1. Camera integration in the Flutter app
2. Image capture and preprocessing
3. API integration with LogMeal for food identification
4. Secondary API call to Spoonacular for detailed nutritional information
5. Local caching of common results to reduce API calls
6. User interface for displaying results and allowing corrections

The estimated development effort is 10-17 days with a combined monthly operating cost of approximately $259-$339 depending on usage volume."
