## Integration with Flutter and Python

This section details the integration process for Flutter (frontend) and Python (backend) with the discussed APIs. A typical flow involves the mobile app capturing an image, sending it to a Python backend, which then processes the image using the chosen computer vision API and returns the results to the mobile app.

```mermaid

    A[Mobile App (Flutter)] --> B{Capture Image}
    B --> C[Send Image to Backend]
    C --> D[Python Backend (Flask/FastAPI)]
    D --> E{Call Computer Vision API}
    E --> F[Computer Vision API (e.g., LogMeal, Calorie Mama)]
    F --> G{Return Recognition Results}
    G --> D
    D --> H[Process Results]
    H --> I[Return Processed Data to Mobile App]
    I --> A
```

### Integration with Flutter (Frontend)

To integrate REST APIs into a Flutter application, the general steps are:

1.  **Add the `http` dependency:** In your Flutter project's `pubspec.yaml` file, add the `http` dependency:

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      flutter:
        sdk: flutter
      http: ^1.2.1
    ```

    After adding, run `flutter pub get` in the terminal.

2.  **Make the HTTP request:** Use the `http` package to make GET, POST, etc. requests. To send an image, you would typically use a POST request with the request body containing the image bytes or a multipart file.

    ```dart
    import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
    import 'dart:convert';
    import 'dart:io';

    Future<Map<String, dynamic>> uploadImageAndGetIngredients(File imageFile) async {
      final url = Uri.parse('YOUR_BACKEND_API_URL');
      var request = http.MultipartRequest('POST', url)
        ..files.add(await http.MultipartFile.fromPath('image', imageFile.path));

      var response = await request.send();

      if (response.statusCode == 200) {
        final responseBody = await response.stream.bytesToString();
        return json.decode(responseBody);
      } else {
        throw Exception('Failed to upload image: ${response.statusCode}');
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Process the response:** The API response (usually JSON) can be decoded and used to display information in the application.

4.  **State management:** Use a state manager (Provider, BLoC, Riverpod, etc.) to manage the application's state and display API data in the user interface.

### Integration with Python (Backend)

For the Python backend, you can use a web framework like Flask or FastAPI to create an endpoint that receives the image from the Flutter application, calls the computer vision API (LogMeal, Calorie Mama, etc.), and returns the results.

#### Example with Flask:

1.  **Install Flask and requests:**

    ```bash
    pip install Flask requests
    ```

2.  **Create `app.py` file:**

    ```python
    from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
    import requests
    import base64

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/analyze_meal', methods=['POST'])
    def analyze_meal():
        if 'image' not in request.files:
            return jsonify({'error': 'No image provided'}), 400

        image_file = request.files['image']
        if image_file.filename == '':
            return jsonify({'error': 'No image selected'}), 400

        if image_file:
            # Read the image in bytes
            image_bytes = image_file.read()

            # Example call to LogMeal API (replace with your key and endpoint)
            logmeal_api_key = 'YOUR_LOGMEAL_API_KEY'
            logmeal_endpoint = 'https://api.logmeal.es/v2/image/recognition/dish'

            headers = {
                'Authorization': f'Bearer {logmeal_api_key}',
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            }
            payload = {
                'image': base64.b64encode(image_bytes).decode('utf-8')
            }

            try:
                response = requests.post(logmeal_endpoint, headers=headers, json=payload)
                response.raise_for_status() # Raise an exception for HTTP errors
                logmeal_result = response.json()
                return jsonify(logmeal_result)
            except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
                return jsonify({'error': f'LogMeal API error: {e}'}), 500

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
    ```
